 Abstract
Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatment today. Here we investigate tissue-wide gene expression heterogeneity throughout a multifocal prostate cancer using the spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology. Utilizing a novel approach for deconvolution, we analyze the transcriptomes of nearly 6750 tissue regions and extract distinct expression profiles for the different tissue components, such as stroma, normal and PIN glands, immune cells and cancer. We distinguish healthy and diseased areas and thereby provide insight into gene expression changes during the progression of prostate cancer. Compared to pathologist annotations, we delineate the extent of cancer foci more accurately, interestingly without link to histological changes. We identify gene expression gradients in stroma adjacent to tumor regions that allow for re-stratification of the tumor microenvironment. The establishment of these profiles is the first step towards an unbiased view of prostate cancer and can serve as a dictionary for future studies.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the abstract, there are no direct keywords that match the items in the schema. However, "prostate cancer" and "spatial transcriptomics" are mentioned, which might suggest potential matches like 'Prostate cancer' and 'Prostate epithelial organoids'.
###Verify###
- "multifocal prostate cancer" and "prostate cancer" in the abstract suggest that 'Prostate cancer' might be a relevant match.
- "spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology" indicates the use of spatial transcriptomics, but it doesn't directly match any organ parts in the schema.
###Context###
- The abstract mentions "different tissue components, such as stroma, normal and PIN glands, immune cells and cancer." This provides context that the study is focused on various components within the prostate tissue.
- "We distinguish healthy and diseased areas and thereby provide insight into gene expression changes during the progression of prostate cancer." This further emphasizes the focus on prostate tissue and its components.
###Conclusion###
Given the context and the specific mention of "prostate cancer" multiple times in the abstract, 'Prostate cancer' is a highly relevant match. However, 'Prostate epithelial organoids' is not directly mentioned or implied strongly enough to be considered a match.
###Result###
['Prostate cancer']
