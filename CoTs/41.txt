 Abstract
Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the phrase "Mus musculus" in the Abstract, it indicates that 'Mus musculus' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The Abstract specifically mentions "the model organism Mus musculus" and "more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues" of Mus musculus, which further verifies that 'Mus musculus' is indeed the species being studied.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Mus musculus' as our final result.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
