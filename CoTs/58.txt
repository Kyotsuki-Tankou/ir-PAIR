 Abstract
Oligodendrocyte pathology is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases as oligodendrocytes both myelinate and provide metabolic support to axons. In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination in the central nervous system thus leads to neurodegeneration, but the severity of MS between patients is very variable. Disability does not correlate well with the extent of demyelination1, which suggests that other factors contribute to this variability. One such factor may be oligodendrocyte heterogeneity. Not all oligodendrocytes are the same-those from the mouse spinal cord inherently produce longer myelin sheaths than those from the cortex2, and single-cell analysis of the mouse central nervous system identified further differences3,4. However, the extent of human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity and its possible contribution to MS pathology remain unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from white matter areas of post-mortem human brain from patients with MS and from unaffected controls. We identified subclusters of oligodendroglia in control human white matter, some with similarities to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Notably, some subclusters were underrepresented in MS tissue, whereas others were more prevalent. These differences in mature oligodendrocyte subclusters may indicate different functional states of oligodendrocytes in MS lesions. We found similar changes in normal-appearing white matter, showing that MS is a more diffuse disease than its focal demyelination suggests. Our findings of an altered oligodendroglial heterogeneity in MS may be important for understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the abstract, keywords such as "oligodendrocyte," "multiple sclerosis (MS)," "central nervous system," "white matter," and "post-mortem human brain" are prominent. However, none of these directly match the organ parts listed in the schema.
### Verify ###
Upon reviewing the abstract, there is no explicit mention of specific organ parts that directly correspond to the schema provided. The focus is on "white matter areas of post-mortem human brain," which could imply 'Brain' or 'Cortex' but is not explicitly stated.
### Context ###
Given the focus on "white matter areas of post-mortem human brain," we can infer that the study primarily involves brain tissue, particularly the white matter regions. This suggests that 'Brain' or 'Cortex' might be the closest relevant organ parts from the schema, but the abstract does not provide enough specific details to conclusively determine this.
### Conclusion ###
Due to the lack of explicit mention of specific organ parts that match the schema, and the general nature of the terms used (e.g., "white matter," "human brain"), it is challenging to definitively assign an organ part from the provided schema. Therefore, we conclude that there is insufficient information to accurately match an organ part from the schema to the input.
### Result ###
null
