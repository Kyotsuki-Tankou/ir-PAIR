 Abstract
Imaging the transcriptome in situ with high accuracy has been a major challenge in single-cell biology, which is particularly hindered by the limits of optical resolution and the density of transcripts in single cells1-5. Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells-with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution-in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals subcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligand-receptor pairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the abstract, there is no direct mention of the species name. However, the context clues "mouse brain" and "in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain" suggest that 'Mus musculus' (house mouse) might be the species used in the study.
### Verify ###
The phrases "mouse brain" and "in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain" explicitly mention "mouse," which is a common term for 'Mus musculus'. This provides strong evidence that 'Mus musculus' is indeed the species involved.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of "mouse brain" in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that 'Mus musculus' is the correct species to be extracted.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus']
