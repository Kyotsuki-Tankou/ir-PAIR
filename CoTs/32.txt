 Abstract
Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional (3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult, limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues. We developed and applied a technology for 3D intact-tissue RNA sequencing, termed STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping), which integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry, targeted signal amplification, and in situ sequencing. The capabilities of STARmap were tested by mapping 160 to 1020 genes simultaneously in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution with high efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Moving to thick tissue blocks, we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter-scale volumes (>30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "mouse brain" in the Abstract indicates that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
From "sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution" and "molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter-scale volumes" in the Abstract, we CAN further verify that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keyword.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Brain' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Brain']
