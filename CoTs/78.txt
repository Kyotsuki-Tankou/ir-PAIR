 Abstract
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) comprise monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and have emerged as key regulators of cancer growth. These cells can diversify into a spectrum of states, which might promote or limit tumor outgrowth but remain poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map TIMs in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. We uncovered 25 TIM states, most of which were reproducibly found across patients. To facilitate translational research of these populations, we also profiled TIMs in mice. In comparing TIMs across species, we identified a near-complete congruence of population structures among dendritic cells and monocytes; conserved neutrophil subsets; and species differences among macrophages. By contrast, myeloid cell population structures in patients' blood showed limited overlap with those of TIMs. This study determines the lung TIM landscape and sets the stage for future investigations into the potential of TIMs as immunotherapy targets. 
 Keywords:dendritic cell heterogeneity; macrophage heterogeneity; mouse-human comparison; myeloid cells; neutrophil heterogeneity; single-cell analysis; tumor immunology; tumor microenvironment.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we have terms like "dendritic cell heterogeneity," "macrophage heterogeneity," "neutrophil heterogeneity," "single-cell analysis," "tumor immunology," and "tumor microenvironment." These terms suggest a focus on specific cell types and their roles in the tumor environment, but they do not directly indicate a specific organ part.
###Verify###
The Abstract mentions "non-small-cell lung cancer patients" and "lung TIM landscape," which strongly suggests that the study is focused on the lung. However, the Keywords do not explicitly mention "lung" or any specific lung-related terms.
###Context###
Given the Abstract's clear focus on "non-small-cell lung cancer patients" and the profiling of TIMs in the lung, it is reasonable to infer that the study's primary organ part of interest is the lung. The Keywords, while detailed about cell types and analysis methods, do not directly list "lung," but the context from the Abstract provides the necessary linkage.
###Conclusion###
Based on the context provided by the Abstract, we can conclude that the primary organ part relevant to this study is the lung, despite the absence of direct mention in the Keywords.
###Result###
['Lung']
