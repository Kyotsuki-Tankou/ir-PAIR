 Abstract
Analysis of the pattern of proteins or messengerRNAs (mRNAs) in histological tissue sections is a cornerstone in biomedical research and diagnostics. This typically involves the visualization of a few proteins or expressed genes at a time. We have devised a strategy, which we call "spatial transcriptomics," that allows visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome with spatial resolution in individual tissue sections. By positioning histological sections on arrayed reverse transcription primers with unique positional barcodes, we demonstrate high-quality RNA-sequencing data with maintained two-dimensional positional information from the mouse brain and human breast cancer. Spatial transcriptomics provides quantitative gene expression data and visualization of the distribution of mRNAs within tissue sections and enables novel types of bioinformatics analyses, valuable in research and diagnostics.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the result provided, "Olfactory bulb" is indicated as a potential organ part. However, the input does not directly mention "Olfactory bulb" in the abstract or keywords.
### Verify ###
The abstract discusses "spatial transcriptomics" and mentions "mouse brain and human breast cancer" as the tissues analyzed. There is no direct mention of "Olfactory bulb."
### Context ###
Given that "Olfactory bulb" is not directly mentioned in the abstract, we need to reconsider the context. The mention of "mouse brain" could imply that specific regions of the brain, such as the "Olfactory bulb," might be included in the spatial transcriptomics analysis, but this is not explicitly stated.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the information provided in the abstract, we cannot conclusively verify that "Olfactory bulb" is a proper result. The abstract does not provide sufficient evidence to directly link the analysis to the "Olfactory bulb."
### Result ###
Since the context does not support the inclusion of "Olfactory bulb" based on the given abstract, the result should be reconsidered. A more accurate extraction based on the abstract would likely focus on "Brain" and "Breast cancer" as mentioned tissues.
Therefore, the revised result should be:
['Brain', 'Breast cancer']
