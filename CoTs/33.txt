 Abstract
Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional (3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult, limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues. We developed and applied a technology for 3D intact-tissue RNA sequencing, termed STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping), which integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry, targeted signal amplification, and in situ sequencing. The capabilities of STARmap were tested by mapping 160 to 1020 genes simultaneously in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution with high efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Moving to thick tissue blocks, we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter-scale volumes (>30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the "Abstract," there are no direct mentions of specific organ parts in the Keywords section. However, the focus on "mouse brain" and "neuron subtypes" suggests that 'Cortex' might be a relevant organ part.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, it is mentioned that "we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter-scale volumes (>30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap." This indicates that the study focused on specific regions within the brain, and the 'Cortex' is a plausible region given its well-known role in housing various neuron subtypes.
###Context###
To further verify, let's consider the context:
- The study involves "sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution."
- The mention of "excitatory-neuron subtypes" and "inhibitory-neuron subtypes" aligns with the known functions and distributions of neurons in the cortex.
###Conclusion###
Given the focus on the brain and the specific mention of neuron subtypes typically found in the cortex, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Cortex' is the correct organ part relevant to this study.
###Result###
['Cortex']
