 Abstract
The hypothalamus controls essential social behaviors and homeostatic functions. However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei-including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types-is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled ~1 million cells, identified ~70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "hypothalamus" is prominently mentioned, which is a region of the brain. This suggests that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region." This further verifies that the study is focused on a specific region of the brain, reinforcing that 'Brain' is a proper result.
###Context###
Given the detailed focus on the hypothalamic preoptic region and the creation of a cell atlas specific to this brain region, there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Brain' as our final result.
###Result###
['Brain']
