 Abstract
To advance our understanding of the genetic programs that drive cell and tissue specialization, it is necessary to obtain a comprehensive overview of gene expression patterns. Here, we have used spatial transcriptomics to generate high-resolution, anteroposterior gene expression maps of C. elegans males and hermaphrodites. To explore these maps, we have developed computational methods for discovering region- and tissue-specific genes. We have found extensive sex-specific gene expression differences in the germline and sperm and discovered genes that are specifically expressed in the male reproductive tract. These include a group of uncharacterized genes that encode small secreted proteins that are required for male fertility. We conclude that spatial gene expression maps provide a powerful resource for identifying tissue-specific gene functions in C. elegans. Importantly, we found that expression maps from different animals can be precisely aligned, enabling transcriptome-wide comparisons of gene expression patterns. 
 Keywords:C.ËÅΩelegans; CEL-seq; germline; mRNA sequencing; male fertility; spatial transcriptomics; sperm.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the Keywords "C. elegans; CEL-seq; germline; mRNA sequencing; male fertility; spatial transcriptomics; sperm," there is no direct mention of any tissue types listed in the schema. However, "germline" and "sperm" suggest a focus on reproductive tissues.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, phrases like "sex-specific gene expression differences in the germline and sperm" and "genes that are specifically expressed in the male reproductive tract" indicate a focus on reproductive tissues. However, none of the specific tissues mentioned in the schema (e.g., 'Skin', 'Brain', 'Colon', etc.) are directly referenced.
### Context ###
Given the context of the study focusing on "C. elegans males and hermaphrodites" and "male reproductive tract," it is clear that the research is centered around reproductive organs. While "germline" and "sperm" are mentioned, these do not directly correspond to any specific tissue in the provided schema list.
### Conclusion ###
Since the specific tissues mentioned in the schema are not directly referenced in either the Keywords or the Abstract, and the context does not provide a clear match to any of the listed tissues, we conclude that there is no suitable tissue type to extract from the given input based on the provided schema.
### Result ###
null
