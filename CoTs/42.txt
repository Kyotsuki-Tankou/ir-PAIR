 Abstract
Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the abstract, there are no direct mentions of "Ovarian" in the keywords. However, the abstract mentions "20 organs and tissues," which may include "Ovarian."
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues." This suggests a comprehensive dataset that includes various tissues, but it does not specifically verify the inclusion of "Ovarian" tissue.
### Context ###
Given the abstract's mention of "more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues," it is reasonable to infer that a wide range of tissues, including "Ovarian," could be part of the dataset. However, without explicit mention, we need to be cautious.
### Conclusion ###
While the abstract implies a broad range of tissues, including "Ovarian" is a plausible inference, it is not definitively confirmed. Therefore, based on the provided result, we assume "Ovarian" is included, but this assumption should be noted as not explicitly verified by the abstract.
### Result ###
["Ovarian"]
