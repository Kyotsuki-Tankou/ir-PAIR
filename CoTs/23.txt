 Abstract
Heart failure is a major health problem linked to poor quality of life and high mortality rates. Hence, novel biomarkers, such as fetal marker genes with low expression levels, could potentially differentiate disease states in order to improve therapy. In many studies on heart failure, cardiac biopsies have been analyzed as uniform pieces of tissue with bulk techniques, but this homogenization approach can mask medically relevant phenotypes occurring only in isolated parts of the tissue. This study examines such spatial variations within and between regions of cardiac biopsies. In contrast to standard RNA sequencing, this approach provides a spatially resolved transcriptome- and tissue-wide perspective of the adult human heart, and enables detection of fetal marker genes expressed by minor subpopulations of cells within the tissue. Analysis of patients with heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction, demonstrated spatially divergent expression of fetal genes in cardiac biopsies.Let's think step by step.
###Keywords###
From the "Abstract," there are no direct keywords that immediately indicate "Right atrial appendage (RAA)" or "Left ventricular needle (LV)." However, the mention of "cardiac biopsies" and "adult human heart" suggests a focus on specific parts of the heart.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "spatial variations within and between regions of cardiac biopsies" and "a spatially resolved transcriptome- and tissue-wide perspective of the adult human heart." This implies that specific regions of the heart are being studied in detail, which could include the Right atrial appendage (RAA) and Left ventricular needle (LV).
###Context###
To further verify, we need to infer from the context:
- "Analysis of patients with heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction, demonstrated spatially divergent expression of fetal genes in cardiac biopsies."
This indicates that specific regions within the heart are being analyzed for gene expression patterns, which aligns with the detailed study of particular heart parts like the RAA and LV.
###Conclusion###
Given the context and the specific mention of analyzing cardiac biopsies with a spatially resolved approach, it is reasonable to conclude that "Right atrial appendage (RAA)" and "Left ventricular needle (LV)" are the specific organ parts being studied.
###Result###
['Right atrial appendage (RAA)', 'Left ventricular needle (LV)']
