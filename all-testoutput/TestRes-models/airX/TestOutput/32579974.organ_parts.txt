### Keywords ###
From the "Keywords," "skin cancer" and "squamous cell carcinoma" suggest a focus on skin-related conditions. "Normal skin" is also mentioned in the context of the study, indicating that 'Skin' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin," which directly verifies that 'Skin' is indeed the tissue of focus in this study.
### Context ###
Since the Abstract and Keywords both clearly point to 'Skin' as the primary tissue of interest, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Skin' as our final result based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the Abstract and Keywords.
### Result ###
['Skin']
