### Keywords ###
The input abstract discusses the development of "high-definition spatial transcriptomics" for capturing RNA from tissue sections on a spatially barcoded array, which is applied to mouse brain and primary breast cancer. This suggests that the technologies 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and 'RNA-seq' are relevant.
### Verify ###
- The abstract mentions "high-definition spatial transcriptomics," which directly ties to the 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technology.
- It also mentions "captures RNA," which is a common process in 'RNA-seq' technology.
### Context ###
There is no additional context needed beyond the direct mention of the technologies in the abstract.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords, verification, and context, we can conclude that the relevant technologies are 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and 'RNA-seq'.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'RNA-seq']
