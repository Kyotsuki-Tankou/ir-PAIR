### Keywords ###
The abstract mentions "primary pancreatic tumors," "ductal cells," "macrophages," "dendritic cells," "cancer cells," and "spatial patterns of gene expression." These keywords suggest that 'Pancreas' and 'Tumor' may be relevant to the schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly states:
- "Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors..."
- This indicates that 'Pancreas' is directly related to the study.
- The mention of "cancer cells" and "primary pancreatic tumors" implies a connection to 'Tumor'.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of primary pancreatic tumors and the role of the pancreas in the study, we conclude that both 'Pancreas' and 'Tumor' are appropriate results.
### Result ###
['Pancreas', 'Tumor']
