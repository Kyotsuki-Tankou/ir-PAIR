###Keywords###
From the input, the term "mouse SCN" directly indicates that 'Mus musculus' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
From the Abstract, phrases like "We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN" and "Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous circadian gene expression between SCN neuron subtypes" verify that 'Mus musculus' is indeed a relevant species since the study focuses on the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Mus musculus' as the final result based on the clear and consistent references to the mouse in the input.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
