###Keywords###
The abstract mentions "mammalian circadian behaviors," "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)," and "ventral hypothalamus," suggesting that 'Brain' might be relevant.
###Verify###
The phrases "mammalian circadian behaviors are orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus" and "We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN" confirm that 'Brain' is a proper result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Brain' as our final result.
