### Keywords
From the input, the term "human" is explicitly mentioned, which suggests that 'Homo sapiens' might be the species used.
### Verify
The phrase "single-cell mRNA sequencing to determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs" in the Abstract directly implies the use of human samples, which corresponds to 'Homo sapiens' in the schema.
### Conclusion
Since the keyword "human" and the verification both point to 'Homo sapiens', we can conclude that it is the correct result.
### Result
['Homo sapiens']
