### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords "mouse SCN," "single-cell RNA-sequencing," "cell types," "circadian gene expression," and "suprachiasmatic nucleus" suggest that the result may be related to 'Brain Hippocampus' or another part of the brain.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus" and "a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse SCN at single-cell resolution," which verifies that the focus is on a brain region.
### Context ###
The context is clear, as the abstract does not mention any other tissues or species other than the SCN in the mouse.
### Conclusion ###
Given the focus on the SCN and the brain, and since the SCN is part of the hypothalamus, which is a part of the brain, we can conclude that the result corresponds to 'Brain Hippocampus'.
### Result ###
['Brain Hippocampus']
