### Keywords ###
The abstract discusses gastruloids and compares them with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. This indicates that 'Embryo development' might be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics"
- "We identify various embryonic cell types that were not previously known to be present in gastruloids"
These statements verify the connection between gastruloids and embryonic development.
### Context ###
The focus on gastruloids, which are three-dimensional aggregates of embryonic stem cells, and the direct comparison with mouse embryos using advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics further confirm the relevance of 'Embryo development'.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords, verification, and context, we confirm 'Embryo development' as the final result.
### Result ###
['Embryo development']
