### Keywords ###
The abstract mentions "skin suction blistering," "epidermal and immune cells," "single-cell RNA sequencing," and "proteomic information from interstitial fluid." These keywords suggest that the study involved the skin tissue and potentially its cellular and molecular aspects.
### Verify ###
The abstract provides more specific details:
- "suction blistering captured epidermal and most immune cells equally well as biopsies"
- "We used skin suction blistering, a painless and nonscarring procedure that can simultaneously sample skin cells and interstitial fluid"
- "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found comparable transcriptional profiles of key inflammatory pathways between blister and biopsy AD"
These statements confirm that the study focused on skin tissue and its cellular aspects using RNA sequencing techniques.
### Context ###
There is no ambiguity in the context, as the abstract clearly states the methods and results, specifically mentioning the skin and its cells.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of skin and the use of single-cell RNA sequencing, it can be concluded that the study involved the 'Skin' tissue.
### Result ###
['Skin']
