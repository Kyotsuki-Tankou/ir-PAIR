###Keywords###
The term "APEX-seq" is explicitly mentioned in the abstract, which indicates that 'APEX-seq' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2," which directly verifies the presence of 'APEX-seq'.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly introduces APEX-seq as a method for RNA sequencing.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mention of APEX-seq in the abstract, we confirm 'APEX-seq' as our final result.
###Result###
['APEX-seq']
