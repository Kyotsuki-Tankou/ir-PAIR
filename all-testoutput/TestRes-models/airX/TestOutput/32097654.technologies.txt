###Verify###
The Abstract explicitly states, "we present single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas," which confirms the use of the technology mentioned in the Keywords.
###Conclusion###
Given the direct mention of "single-cell RNA sequencing" in the Abstract, we can conclude that 'scRNA' is the appropriate technology used in the study.
###Result###
['scRNA']
