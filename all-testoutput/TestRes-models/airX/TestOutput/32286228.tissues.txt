###Keywords###
From the input, the term "bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells" and "marrow cavity" suggest that 'Bone' and 'Blood vessel' may be proper results.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "mesenchymal stem cells" and "osteoblasts and adipocytes," which are associated with bone development and metabolism. This implies that 'Bone' is a relevant tissue type. Additionally, the term "marrow vasculature" indicates the presence of blood vessels within the bone marrow, suggesting 'Blood vessel' as a relevant tissue.
###Context###
The study focuses on "mesenchymal progenitors at different stages and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult, and aging mice." This context further supports the involvement of 'Bone' and 'Blood vessel' as these tissues are integral to the study's subject matter.
###Conclusion###
Given the context and the specific mention of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells and their interactions with blood vessels, we can conclude that 'Bone' and 'Blood vessel' are the tissues being studied.
###Result###
['Bone', 'Blood vessel']
