### Keywords ###
From the abstract, we can extract the following keywords that could potentially match the species in the schema:
- "mouse gastruloids"
- "mouse embryos"
- "single-cell RNA sequencing"
- "spatial transcriptomics"
### Verify ###
- "mouse gastruloids" and "mouse embryos" suggest the species "Mus musculus" is involved.
- "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" indicate that these techniques are used on mice, supporting the presence of "Mus musculus" in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the specific mention of "mouse gastruloids" and "mouse embryos" in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that "Mus musculus" is a species involved in the study.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus']
