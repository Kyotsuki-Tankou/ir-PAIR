###Keywords###
The abstract mentions "whole-brain spatial transcriptomics" and "molecular atlas" as key methods used. These terms suggest a focus on brain-related research.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "We aimed to generate a systematic classification of the adult mouse brain based purely on the unbiased identification of spatially defining features by employing whole-brain spatial transcriptomics."
- "The molecular information was sufficient to deduce the complex and detailed neuroanatomical organization of the brain."
These statements verify that the research involves the adult mouse brain and molecular mapping.
###Context###
The context of the research is clearly centered around the adult mouse brain, which directly corresponds to the "Brain" item in the schema.
###Conclusion###
Given the direct focus on the adult mouse brain in the research described in the abstract, it is clear that the corresponding item in the schema is "Brain".
###Result###
['Brain']
