### Keywords ###
The keywords "digit tip amputation," "blastema," "mouse digit tip blastemas," and "fibroblasts" suggest that there are specific organ parts or tissues related to the regeneration process in mammals, potentially matching items from the schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "mouse digit tip blastemas" and "unamputated control digit tips," indicating a clear focus on the digit tip regeneration process in mice. The mention of "fibroblasts" and "blastema" also points to specific cell types and structures involved in the regeneration process.
### Context ###
The context is directly related to the schema, as the regeneration process involves the digit tip (which could be considered a part of the "Femur" or "Hindpaw" in the schema) and involves fibroblasts and blastema formation, which are not directly listed in the schema but are related to "Tibialis anterior muscle" or "Skin."
### Conclusion ###
The specific mention of "digit tip blastemas" and the process of digit tip regeneration, along with the involvement of fibroblasts, suggests that the regeneration process in mammals is associated with organ parts that are part of the limbs. Given the schema, the closest matches are "Femur" and "Hindpaw."
### Result ###
['Femur', 'Hindpaw']
