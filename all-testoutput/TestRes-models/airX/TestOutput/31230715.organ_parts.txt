### Keywords ###
From the term "spatial transcriptomics" in the Keywords, it indicates that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome," which further verifies that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is indeed a proper result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
