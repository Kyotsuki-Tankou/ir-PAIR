###Keywords###
The terms "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "spatial transcriptomics method" suggest that the technologies 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are relevant.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method that reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple adjacent cells, with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample," which confirms that both 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are indeed the technologies used.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the verification step provides clear evidence for the technologies mentioned.
###Conclusion###
Based on the evidence provided, we can conclude that the technologies 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are appropriate for the given input.
###Result###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
