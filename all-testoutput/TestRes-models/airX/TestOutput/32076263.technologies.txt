### Keywords ###
The input mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics," which are both technologies listed in the schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly states "Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics," confirming that these technologies are used in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of both technologies in the abstract, we can conclude that they are the proper results.
### Result ###
['single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatial transcriptomics']
