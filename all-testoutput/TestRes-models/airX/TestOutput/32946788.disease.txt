### Keywords ###
From the abstract, we can identify several terms that may correspond to the schema, including "HSC" (Hematopoietic stem cells), "embryo," "endothelin," "hematopoiesis," "single cell transcriptome," and "spatial transcriptome."
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "HSCs first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region"
- "spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta"
- "gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells"
- "endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development"
These points verify that the terms "Hematopoietic stem cells," "embryo," "endothelin," and "hematopoiesis" are relevant to the schema.
### Context ###
The context of the abstract provides a detailed look at the research involving hematopoietic stem cells in the AGM region of the embryo and the use of spatial transcriptomics and gene expression profiling. The mention of endothelin 1 as a regulator of HSC development is particularly relevant to the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the direct references to hematopoietic stem cells, embryonic development, and hematopoiesis in the abstract, we can conclude that the items corresponding to the schema are present.
### Result ###
[
  'Hematopoietic stem cells',
  'embryo',
  'endothelin',
  'hematopoiesis'
