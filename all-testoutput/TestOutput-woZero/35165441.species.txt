###Verify###
Phrases like "human brain vasculature," "143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 8 individuals with no cognitive impairment," and "human arteriovenous organization" strongly confirm that the study is conducted on humans.
###Context###

###Conclusion###
Given the clear and consistent focus on human subjects, we conclude that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
