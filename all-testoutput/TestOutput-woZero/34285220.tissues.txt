### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse embryo" and "subcellular and subnuclear microstructures" are key. The term "Embryo" directly matches the schema, and "stress granules" is also mentioned explicitly.
### Verify ###
- The abstract mentions "expression profiles specifically from photo-irradiated regions of interest in the mouse embryo," which confirms the relevance of 'Embryo'.
- The term "stress granules" is explicitly mentioned, confirming its relevance.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on "multicellular organisms" and specifically on "mouse embryo," indicating a primary interest in embryonic tissues.
- The mention of "subcellular and subnuclear microstructures" like "stress granules" suggests a detailed analysis at the subcellular level, but the primary tissue of interest remains the embryo.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention and focus on "mouse embryo" and "stress granules," we can conclude that 'Embryo' and 'Stress granules' are the relevant tissues to extract.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Stress granules']
