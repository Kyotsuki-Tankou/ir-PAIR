### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "digit tip regeneration" and "blastema" are prominent, suggesting a focus on regeneration processes, particularly in the context of digit tips. "Mammals" and "mouse digit tip blastemas" indicate the study's focus on regenerative processes in mammalian digits.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions:
- "Innate regeneration following digit tip amputation"
- "Digit tip regeneration is mediated by the blastema"
- "single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas"
These points verify that the study is specifically focused on the regeneration of digit tips in mice, involving the blastema structure.
### Context ###
The context of the study revolves around understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of digit tip regeneration, which is a form of tissue repair and regeneration.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear focus on "digit tip regeneration" and the involvement of blastema, the most relevant disease term from the schema that aligns with this context is "Digit Regeneration."
### Result ###
['Digit Regeneration']
