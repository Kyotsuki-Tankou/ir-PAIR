### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma," "tumor tissue," "ovarian carcinoma," and "chemotherapy." These suggest that 'Ovarian carcinoma' or 'Breast Cancer' might be relevant organ parts.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "spatial transcriptomics of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma using intact tumor tissue"
- "patients with highly annotated high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma"
This directly verifies that 'Ovarian carcinoma' is indeed the relevant organ part.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma" and focuses on tumor tissue from these patients, there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this organ part.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Ovarian carcinoma' as our final result. The provided result 'Breast Cancer' does not match the context of the abstract.
### Result ###
['Ovarian carcinoma']
