###Keywords###
From the abstract, the key terms related to tissues are "intestinal epithelium," "small intestine," "colon," and "tuft cells." These suggest potential matches with the schema.
###Verify###
- "intestinal epithelium" and "small intestine" suggest 'Ileum' and 'Colon' from the schema.
- "colon" directly matches 'Colon' in the schema.
- "tuft cells" are associated with the intestinal epithelium, reinforcing 'Ileum' and 'Colon'.
###Context###
- The study focuses on the role of DDX5 in tuft cell specification and function in the intestine, specifically mentioning both the small intestine and the colon.
- The results discuss changes in the intestinal tuft cell populations and their impact on ileal inflammation and colonic tumourigenesis.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mentions of the small intestine and colon, and the context of intestinal epithelium and tuft cells, it is reasonable to conclude that both 'Ileum' and 'Colon' are relevant tissues for this study.
###Result###
['Ileum', 'Colon']
