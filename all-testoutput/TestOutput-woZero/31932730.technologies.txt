### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the key technologies mentioned are "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "spatial transcriptomics."
### Verify ###
- **scRNA-seq**: The abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" multiple times, confirming its use.
- **Spatial Transcriptomics**: The abstract describes a method that "reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots," which aligns with the definition of spatial transcriptomics.
### Conclusion ###
Both "scRNA-seq" and "Spatial Transcriptomics" are clearly mentioned and used in the study, making them appropriate matches from the provided schema.
### Result ###
["scRNA-seq", "Spatial Transcriptomics"]
