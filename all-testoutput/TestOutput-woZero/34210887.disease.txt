### Keywords ###
From the abstract, key terms include "spatial transcriptomics," "developing mouse embryos," "single-cell resolution," "spatial heterogeneity," "anatomically patterned expression," and "mammalian development."
### Verify ###
The abstract focuses on the application of a new method, sci-Space, to study gene expression patterns in developing mouse embryos. It mentions "anatomically patterned expression" and "mammalian development," which suggest a focus on normal developmental processes rather than specific diseases.
### Context ###
The context of the study is clearly centered around understanding the normal development of mouse embryos. There is no mention of any disease or pathological condition in the abstract.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords and context, the study is primarily concerned with normal developmental processes, particularly in mouse embryos. Therefore, the most appropriate match from the provided schema is "Embryo development."
### Result ###
["Embryo development"]
