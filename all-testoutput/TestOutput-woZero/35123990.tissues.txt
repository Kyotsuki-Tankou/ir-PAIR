### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "keloid tissue samples" and "normal skin control" are mentioned, indicating that 'Skin' is a relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Keloid tissue samples and normal skin control data were analyzed..."
- "Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed cellular heterogenicity such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), and myofibroblasts within the keloids."
- "Spatial transcriptomics results showed that disease-associated fibroblasts were enriched in the deeper keloid areas..."
These statements verify that the study primarily involves 'Skin' tissue, specifically focusing on keloids and normal skin.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear focus on keloid tissue and normal skin in the study, we can confidently conclude that 'Skin' is the appropriate tissue to be extracted according to the schema.
### Result ###
["Skin"]
