###Keywords###
From the phrase "patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids" and "prostate tissue explants," it indicates that 'Homo sapiens' may be the species being studied.
###Verify###
The Abstract specifically mentions "patient-derived" and "prostate tissue explants," which implies human tissue. Additionally, the context of studying vitamin D deficiency in relation to human prostate cancer further verifies that 'Homo sapiens' is indeed the species being studied.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as our final result.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
