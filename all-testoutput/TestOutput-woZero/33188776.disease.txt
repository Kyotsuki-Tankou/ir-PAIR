###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse embryos" and "developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology" suggest potential disease-related contexts. Specifically, "mouse embryos" indicates a focus on early development, which could relate to 'Embryo development' or 'Embryonic development'.
###Verify###
- The abstract mentions "Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis," which directly verifies the involvement of 'Embryo development' or 'Embryonic development'.
- The mention of potential applications in "developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology" does not specify any particular disease but suggests a broad range of possible applications.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the term "mouse embryos" and the context of early organogenesis clearly specify the focus on embryonic development.
###Conclusion###
Based on the clear mention of "mouse embryos" and the context of early organogenesis, we can confidently conclude that 'Embryo development' or 'Embryonic development' is the appropriate disease-related context.
###Result###
['Embryo development', 'Embryonic development']
