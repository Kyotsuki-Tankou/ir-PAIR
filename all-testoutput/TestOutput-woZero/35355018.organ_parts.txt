### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "human distal airways," "terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs)," "lung development," and "lung injury" suggest that the organ parts involved are related to the lung.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions "human distal airways," "terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs)," and "lung development," which align with the organ parts related to the lung.
### Context ###
The abstract also mentions "using a non-human primate model of lung injury," which indicates the study involves both human and non-human primate lung tissues. However, the primary focus is on human distal airways and TRBs.
### Conclusion ###
Given the consistent focus on human distal airways and TRBs, we can conclude that the relevant organ parts are related to the lung.
### Result ###
["Upper pulmonary branches", "Postmortem Lung", "Lung organoid"]
