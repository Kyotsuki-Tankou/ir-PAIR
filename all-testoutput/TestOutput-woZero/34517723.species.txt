### Keywords ###
From the abstract, there are no direct mentions of any species. However, the keywords "inflammasomes," "inflammation," "interleukin-1," "monocytes," "smooth muscle myocytes," and "vasculitis" suggest a focus on human-related biomedical research.
### Verify ###
The keywords listed are predominantly associated with human physiology and disease, particularly those related to the immune system and vascular conditions. These terms are commonly used in the context of human health and research.
### Context ###
Given the absence of any species-specific terms and the strong association of the keywords with human biomedical research, it is reasonable to infer that the study is likely conducted on or relevant to humans.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, "Homo sapiens" is the most appropriate choice from the provided schema, as it best reflects the likely focus of the study.
### Result ###
["Homo sapiens"]
