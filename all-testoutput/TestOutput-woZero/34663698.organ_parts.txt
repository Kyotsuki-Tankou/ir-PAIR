###Keywords###
From the abstract, terms like "cranial bone," "cranial suture," and "skeletal innervation" are prominent. This suggests that 'Bone' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract focuses on "the genetic inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) sensory nerve innervation of the developing cranium" and discusses "mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) fate" in the context of bone development. This further verifies that 'Bone' is indeed a relevant and proper result.
###Context###
The detailed discussion on "cranial suture closure," "mineralization," and "bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-Î² signaling pathway transcripts" in the context of bone development provides additional context that aligns with 'Bone' as the appropriate result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Bone' as our final result based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the keywords and the abstract.
###Result###
['Bone']
