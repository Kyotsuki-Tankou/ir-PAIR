### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "human brain metastases" and "brain metastasis tumor microenvironment" suggest that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "we analyze human brain metastases" and "these clonally unrelated, phenotypically distinct CD8+T cell populations occupy discrete niches within the brain metastasis tumor microenvironment," which further supports that 'Brain' is indeed the organ part being studied.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain' as our final result.
### Result ###
