### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "vaping-induced pulmonary injury," "lung tissue architecture," and "upper airway" are prominent, suggesting a focus on pulmonary and respiratory systems. This indicates that technologies related to transcriptional analysis might be used, such as 'RNA-seq'.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "Transcriptional reprogramming includes significant changes to gene families coding for xenobiotic response, glycerolipid metabolic processes, and oxidative stress," which directly implies the use of a technology capable of analyzing transcriptional changes, such as 'RNA-seq'.
### Context ###
The context of the study involves analyzing the impact of vaping on lung tissue at a molecular level, which typically requires technologies that can assess gene expression changes. 'RNA-seq' is a common technology used for such purposes.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear mention of transcriptional reprogramming and the focus on gene expression changes, 'RNA-seq' is the appropriate technology identified in the input.
### Result ###
['RNA-seq']
