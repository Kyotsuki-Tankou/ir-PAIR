###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "brain development," "embryonic mouse brain," and "developmental program for the functional elements of the brain" are prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Brain development' and 'Embryonic development' may be relevant disease categories.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay..."
- "a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth"
- "identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain"
These statements directly verify that 'Brain development' and 'Embryonic development' are indeed relevant disease categories in this context.
###Context###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the focus on brain development and embryonic stages, there is no need for additional context to confirm the results.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain development' and 'Embryonic development' as the final results based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['Brain development', 'Embryonic development']
