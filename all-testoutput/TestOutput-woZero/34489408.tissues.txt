###Keywords###
From the input, terms like "colorectal cancer (CRC)", "liver metastases", and "tumor microenvironment (TME)" suggest that 'Liver' and 'Colon' might be relevant tissues.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC"
- "an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood"
These statements clearly verify the involvement of 'Liver' and 'Colon' tissues in the study.
###Context###
The context of the study revolves around the comparison of primary CRC (colon) and its liver metastases. Both tissues are central to the research focus and are explicitly mentioned multiple times.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Liver' and 'Colon' as the final results based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['Liver', 'Colon']
