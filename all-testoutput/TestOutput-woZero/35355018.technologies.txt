### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "spatial transcriptomics" and "single-cell profiling" stand out as potential matches to the technologies listed in the schema.
### Verify ###
- The abstract explicitly mentions "spatial transcriptomics," which directly matches one of the technologies in the schema.
- "Single-cell profiling" is a broader term but can be associated with several single-cell technologies like 'scRNA', 'scATAC-seq', etc. However, the specific mention of "spatial transcriptomics" narrows down the focus.
### Context ###
- The study involves "microdissected distal airways" and the identification of "molecularly distinct TRB cell types," which aligns well with the capabilities of spatial transcriptomics.
- The use of "connectome maps" and "organoid-based co-cultures" further supports the application of advanced spatial and molecular techniques, reinforcing the role of spatial transcriptomics.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention and contextual support, we can confidently conclude that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is the primary technology used in this study.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
