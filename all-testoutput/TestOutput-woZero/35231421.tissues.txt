### Keywords ###
From the abstract, prominent keywords include "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)," "B cell responses," "tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)," "IgG-producing PCs," and "immune checkpoint inhibitors." These terms suggest a focus on cancer, specifically renal cell carcinoma, and the immune response within the tumor microenvironment.
### Verify ###
Upon reviewing the abstract, the specific mention of "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" directly corresponds to a disease rather than a tissue type. However, the context of the study involves the tumor microenvironment and immune responses, which are associated with the tissue affected by the cancer.
### Context ###
Given the focus on "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)," the primary tissue involved is the kidney, as RCC originates in the renal cells. The study's emphasis on intratumoral structures and immune responses further supports the involvement of kidney tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and the context of the study, the most relevant tissue from the provided schema is 'Kidney.'
### Result ###
["Kidney"]
