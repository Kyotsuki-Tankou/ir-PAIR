### Keywords ###
From "human liver" and "hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells" in the Abstract, it suggests that 'Liver' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "the human liver" multiple times and discusses the interactions of hepatic cells, directly aligning with the 'Liver' tissue type.
### Context ###
Given that the Abstract specifically focuses on the human liver, its cellular components, and the application of single-cell transcriptional approaches to study it, the context strongly supports the 'Liver' tissue type. There is no conflicting information that would necessitate a different conclusion.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Liver' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Liver']
