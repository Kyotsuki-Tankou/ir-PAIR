### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "tuft cells," "intestinal epithelium," "small intestine," "colon," "tumourigenesis," "ileal inflammation," and "colonic tumourigenesis." These keywords suggest that the study is focused on the intestine, particularly in the context of inflammation and tumourigenesis.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "tuft cells residing in the intestinal epithelium" and discusses their roles in both the small intestine and the colon. It also highlights the impact of DDX5 on "ileal inflammation and colonic tumourigenesis." These details directly indicate that the primary tissue of interest is the intestine.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on the intestinal epithelium, the specific mention of the small intestine and colon, and the discussion of diseases such as inflammation and tumourigenesis in these areas, there is no need for additional context to verify the tissue type.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm that 'Intestine' is the appropriate tissue type based on the provided abstract.
### Result ###
['Intestine']
### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords related to diseases are "ileal inflammation," "colonic tumourigenesis," and "colon carcinogenesis." These suggest that the study is focused on diseases related to the intestine, particularly inflammation and cancer.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly mentions "ileal inflammation and colonic tumourigenesis" and "colon carcinogenesis." These terms directly correspond to diseases listed in the schema, specifically "Intestinal development," "Colon regeneration and repair," and "Colorectal cancer."
### Context ###
The detailed discussion of tuft cells and their roles in inflammation and tumourigenesis in the intestine provides a clear context that aligns with the diseases mentioned.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of these diseases, we can confidently conclude that the relevant diseases from the schema are "Intestinal development," "Colon regeneration and repair," and "Colorectal cancer."
### Result ###
['Intestinal development', 'Colon regeneration and repair', 'Colorectal cancer']
