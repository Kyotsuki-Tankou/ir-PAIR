### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell transcriptomics" and "spatial transcriptomics" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and possibly 'scRNA' (single-cell RNA) may be relevant technologies.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
1. "Here we show in vivo barcoding of early progenitors to simultaneously profile cell phenotypes and clonal relations in the mouse brain using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics."
2. "We combined spatial transcriptomics with clonal barcoding and disentangled migration patterns of clonally related cells in densely labeled tissue sections."
These statements directly verify the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'. The mention of "single-cell transcriptomics" suggests the potential use of 'scRNA'.
### Context ###
The context confirms the use of both 'single-cell transcriptomics' and 'spatial transcriptomics'. The abstract emphasizes the combination of these technologies to achieve the study's objectives.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions and the context provided, we can confidently conclude that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and 'scRNA' are the appropriate technologies used in the study.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA']
