### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single cell RNA-seq" and "Cluster RNA-seq" are mentioned, indicating the use of these technologies in the study.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states "Using single cell RNA-seq and Cluster RNA-seq," which directly verifies the use of these technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'single cell RNA-seq' and 'Cluster RNA-seq' as our final results. Note that 'Cluster RNA-seq' is not listed in the schema, so we will only include 'single cell RNA-seq'.
### Result ###
['single cell RNA-seq']
