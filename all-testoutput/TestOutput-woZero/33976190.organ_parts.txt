### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the primary focus is on the "kidney and upper urinary tract," specifically mentioning the "ureteric bud," "nephron formation," and "nephric duct." These terms suggest that the relevant organ parts could include "Kidney," "Upper urinary tract," and potentially "Embryo" due to the mention of developmental processes.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly discusses the development of the kidney and upper urinary tract, focusing on the ureteric bud and nephric duct, which are integral parts of the kidney. Additionally, the mention of the intermediate mesoderm of the embryo indicates a developmental context.
### Context ###
The context of the study revolves around the developmental processes of the kidney and upper urinary tract, emphasizing the roles of specific progenitor cell populations and transcription factors. This aligns with the organ parts related to kidney development and embryonic structures.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear focus on the kidney and its developmental aspects, along with the mention of the embryo, we can conclude that the relevant organ parts are "Kidney," "Upper urinary tract," and "Embryo."
### Result ###
['Kidney', 'Upper urinary tract', 'Embryo']
