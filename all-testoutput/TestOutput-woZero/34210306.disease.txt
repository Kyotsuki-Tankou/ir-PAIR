### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "SHH medulloblastoma" directly, which is a type of brain tumor. This term clearly indicates a disease-related context.
### Context ###
The study focuses on the development of cerebellar granule cells and their comparison with medulloblastoma cells. The mention of "SHH medulloblastoma" and the comparison between normal development and tumorigenesis provide a strong context for disease-related research.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of "SHH medulloblastoma" and the study's focus on understanding the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, it is clear that the disease being studied is medulloblastoma.
### Result ###
["SHH medulloblastoma"]
