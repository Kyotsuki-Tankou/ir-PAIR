###Keywords###
From the abstract, keywords like "brain regions," "single-cell resolution," "mouse hippocampus," "prefrontal cortex," and "differential isoform expression (DIE)" suggest a focus on neurological processes and specific brain structures.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly mentions "mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex" and discusses "differential isoform expression between brain regions," which directly corresponds to specific brain regions and their cellular characteristics.
###Conclusion###
The abstract clearly indicates a focus on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which are specific brain regions. Therefore, the relevant diseases or conditions from the schema would be those directly related to these brain regions.
###Result###
["Brain Hippocampus", "Brain Cortex"]
