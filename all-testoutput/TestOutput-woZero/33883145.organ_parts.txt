###Keywords###
From the "Abstract," the keywords related to organ parts are "mouse tumor models" and "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)." This suggests that 'MC38 syngeneic tumor' might be a relevant organ part since it involves a mouse tumor model.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, it is mentioned that "we used XYZeq to profile mouse tumor models to capture spatially barcoded transcriptomes from tens of thousands of cells." This indicates that the study focused on specific tumor models in mice. The 'MC38 syngeneic tumor' is a well-known mouse tumor model, making it a plausible choice.
###Context###
To further verify, let's consider the context:
- The study involves "mouse tumor models," which aligns with the use of syngeneic tumors in research.
- The mention of "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)" and their spatial distribution suggests a focus on tumor microenvironments, which is typical in studies using syngeneic tumor models.
###Conclusion###
Given the focus on mouse tumor models and the specific mention of tumor-associated MSCs, it is reasonable to conclude that 'MC38 syngeneic tumor' is the correct organ part relevant to this study.
###Result###
['MC38 syngeneic tumor']
