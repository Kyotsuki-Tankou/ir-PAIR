### Keywords ###
From the "Abstract," the mention of "mouse brain and primary breast cancer" suggests that the species involved in the study are likely "Mus musculus" (mouse) and "Homo sapiens" (human).
### Verify ###
The Abstract explicitly mentions "mouse brain," which directly corresponds to "Mus musculus." Additionally, "primary breast cancer" typically refers to human samples, corresponding to "Homo sapiens."
### Context ###
The context provided in the Abstract supports the identification of these species:
- "Each experiment recovers several hundred thousand transcript-coupled spatial barcodes at 2-Î¼m resolution, as demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer."
This clearly indicates the use of mouse and human tissues for the experiments.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of "mouse brain" and "primary breast cancer" in the Abstract, it is clear that the species involved are "Mus musculus" and "Homo sapiens."
### Result ###
['Mus musculus', 'Homo sapiens']
