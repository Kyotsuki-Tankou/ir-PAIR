### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "intestinal development" and "intestinal crypt" suggest a focus on the 'Intestine'. "Human development" and "human developmental cell atlas" further reinforce the context of human tissues, specifically the intestine.
### Verify ###
From the Abstract, "Development of the human intestine is not well understood. Here, we link single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize intestinal morphogenesis through time." This directly verifies that 'Intestine' is indeed the tissue of focus in this study.
### Context ###
Since the Abstract and Keywords both clearly point to 'Intestine' as the primary tissue of interest, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Intestine' as our final result based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the Abstract and Keywords.
### Result ###
['Intestine']
