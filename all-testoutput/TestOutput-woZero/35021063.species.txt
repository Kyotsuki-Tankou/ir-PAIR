###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "human" and "murine" indicate the species involved in the study. These correspond to "Homo sapiens" and "Mus musculus" in the schema.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver," which directly references both human (Homo sapiens) and murine (Mus musculus) species. This verifies that both 'Homo sapiens' and 'Mus musculus' are relevant and proper results.
###Context###
Given the direct and clear mention of "human and murine liver" in both the abstract and the keywords, there is no need for additional context to verify the species.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' and 'Mus musculus' as our final results based on the clear and consistent references in the abstract.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens', 'Mus musculus']
