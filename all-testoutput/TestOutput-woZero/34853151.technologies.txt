### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that '10x Visium' may be a proper result. Additionally, the keywords "spatial" and "transcriptomics" suggest the use of spatial transcriptomic technologies.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Using the 10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution, we generated spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and repair time course"
This statement clearly verifies the use of '10x Visium' technology in the study.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of '10x Visium', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm '10x Visium' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['10x Visium']
