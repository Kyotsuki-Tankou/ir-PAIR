### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the following tissues are mentioned or implied:
- 'Uterus' (directly mentioned)
- 'Endometrium' (directly mentioned, part of the uterus)
- 'Epithelium' (mentioned in the context of epithelial lineages)
- 'Gland' (mentioned in the context of glandular microenvironments)
- 'Cell line' (implied by the use of organoid cultures)
### Verify ###
- 'Uterus': Directly mentioned in the abstract.
- 'Endometrium': Directly mentioned as the focus of the study.
- 'Epithelium': Mentioned in the context of epithelial lineages.
- 'Gland': Mentioned in the context of glandular microenvironments.
- 'Cell line': Implied by the use of three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures.
### Context ###
The abstract focuses on the endometrium, which is a part of the uterus, and discusses epithelial lineages and glandular microenvironments. The use of organoid cultures implies the involvement of cell lines.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the direct mentions and implied contexts, the following tissues are relevant:
- 'Uterus'
- 'Endometrium' (though not explicitly listed in the schema, it is a part of the uterus)
- 'Epithelium'
- 'Gland'
- 'Cell line'
Since 'Endometrium' is not listed in the schema, it should not be included in the final result.
### Result ###
['Uterus', 'Epithelium', 'Gland', 'Cell line']
