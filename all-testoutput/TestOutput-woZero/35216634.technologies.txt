### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "CCK-8, western blot, cell count and flow cytometry (FCM) assays" suggests the use of various biochemical and cell-based assays, but none of these directly match the technologies listed in the schema. However, the context of the study involves detailed cellular and molecular analysis, which might imply the use of advanced sequencing or imaging technologies.
### Verify ###
Upon closer inspection, none of the specific technologies listed in the schema (e.g., 'CITE-seq', 'RNA-seq', 'seqFISH+', etc.) are explicitly mentioned in the abstract. The methods mentioned (CCK-8, western blot, cell count, FCM) do not correspond to the technologies in the schema.
### Context ###
Given the nature of the study, which involves molecular mechanisms and cellular responses, it is possible that sequencing or imaging technologies could have been used to support the findings. However, the absence of explicit mentions of these technologies in the abstract suggests they were not the primary methods used.
### Conclusion ###
Since none of the technologies listed in the schema are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the context, we conclude that the abstract does not provide sufficient evidence to extract any of the listed technologies.
### Result ###
null
