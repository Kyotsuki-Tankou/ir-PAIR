### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords "CITE-seq" and "spatial transcriptomics" directly indicate the technologies used.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics," which further confirms that the technologies being used are indeed 'CITE-seq' and 'spatial transcriptomics'.
### Conclusion ###
Since both the keywords and the context in the abstract consistently point to 'CITE-seq' and 'spatial transcriptomics', we can confidently conclude that these are the correct technologies.
### Result ###
['CITE-seq', 'spatial transcriptomics']
