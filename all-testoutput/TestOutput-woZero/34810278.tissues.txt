### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "pulmonary injury," "lung tissue architecture," and "upper airway" are prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Lung' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions "vaping-induced pulmonary injury" and "pathological changes to upper airway, lung tissue architecture," which further verifies that 'Lung' is indeed a relevant tissue type in this context.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on pulmonary injury and the changes observed in lung tissue, there is no need for additional context to confirm the relevance of 'Lung'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Lung' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on pulmonary injury and lung tissue changes throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Lung']
