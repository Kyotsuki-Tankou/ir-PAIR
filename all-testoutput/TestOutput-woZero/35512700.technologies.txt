### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, we identify "utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq)" and from the Keywords, we see "Stereo-seq" and "spatial transcriptomics." This indicates that 'Stereo-seq' is a relevant technology.
### Verify ###
The Abstract explicitly mentions "utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq)" for dissecting spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes. This directly verifies the use of 'Stereo-seq' as a key technology in the study.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the result without ambiguity.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Stereo-seq' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Stereo-seq']
