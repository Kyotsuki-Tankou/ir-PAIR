###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "neonatal heart regeneration model," "adult mouse heart," and "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes" are mentioned. This suggests that 'Heart' and potentially 'Mouse Embryo' (since neonatal refers to newborns which can be associated with embryos in a research context) might be relevant organ parts.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "using the mammalian neonatal heart regeneration model," which directly involves the 'Heart'.
- It also mentions "adult mouse heart," further confirming the involvement of the 'Heart'.
- The term "neonatal" could imply early developmental stages, potentially linking to 'Mouse Embryo', but it is not explicitly stated.
###Context###
- The context of "neonatal heart regeneration model" and "adult mouse heart" strongly supports the 'Heart' as a key organ part.
- The mention of "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes" does not directly fit any organ part in the schema but is related to cardiac tissue.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mentions and the context, we can confidently conclude that 'Heart' is the correct organ part involved in this study. 'Mouse Embryo' is a potential but less certain match due to the ambiguity of the term "neonatal."
###Result###
['Heart']
