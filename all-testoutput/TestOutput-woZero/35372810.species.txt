###Keywords###
From the keywords "Cell biology", "Pathophysiology", and "Transcriptomics", we can infer that the study involves biological processes and diseases, but they do not directly indicate the species used. However, the input text mentions "mouse and human kidneys," which suggests the species involved.
###Verify###
The input text explicitly mentions:
- "We applied Slide-seqV2 to mouse and human kidneys"
- "nine distinct human kidneys"
- "in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease"
- "in a mouse model of a toxic proteinopathy"
These statements confirm the use of "Mus musculus" (mouse) and "Homo sapiens" (human).
###Conclusion###
Since the verification step confirms the presence of both "Mus musculus" and "Homo sapiens" in the study, we can conclude that these are the correct species to extract according to the schema.
###Result###
['Mus musculus', 'Homo sapiens']
