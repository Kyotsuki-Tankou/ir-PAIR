### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the key terms related to tissues are "cortex," "adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex," "human primary visual cortex," and "mouse brain." These terms suggest a focus on cortical and brain tissues.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex"
- "human primary visual cortex"
- "mouse brain"
These terms directly correspond to "Cortex" and "Brain" from the provided schema.
### Context ###
The study involves:
- Assessing cortical lamination in the adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex and human primary visual cortex.
- Characterizing cerebral ischemic infarction in the mouse brain.
These contexts strongly align with "Cortex" and "Brain" as the primary tissues of interest.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the direct mentions and the context of the study, the most appropriate tissues from the schema are "Cortex" and "Brain."
### Result ###
["Cortex", "Brain"]
