### Keywords ###
From the input, terms like "metastasis," "oral carcinomas," and "melanoma" indicate the diseases involved.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid or linoleic acid, promotes metastasis in oral carcinomas and melanoma in mice."
- "Tumours from mice that were fed a short-term palm-oil-rich diet (PA), or tumour cells that were briefly exposed to PA in vitro, remained highly metastatic."
These statements verify that the diseases being studied are 'Oral carcinomas' and 'Melanoma'.
### Conclusion ###
Since the keywords and the context in the abstract both confirm the diseases, we can conclude that 'Oral carcinomas' and 'Melanoma' are the correct results.
### Result ###
['Oral carcinomas', 'Melanoma']
