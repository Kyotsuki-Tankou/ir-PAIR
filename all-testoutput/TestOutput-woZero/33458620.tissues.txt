### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "Vitamin D", "prostate gland", "prostatic epithelial differentiation", "patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids", and "Wnt activity". These keywords suggest a focus on the prostate gland and its cellular processes.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "The prostate gland is hormonally regulated"
- "Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer"
- "patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were grown in vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient conditions"
- "Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics"
These points verify that the study is deeply involved in understanding the effects of Vitamin D on the prostate gland, particularly in the context of epithelial differentiation and cancer risk.
### Context ###
While the abstract discusses the prostate gland extensively, it does not mention other tissues. The focus is clearly on the prostate and its cellular and molecular responses to Vitamin D.
### Conclusion ###
Given the exclusive focus on the prostate gland and its regulation by Vitamin D, "Prostate" is the most appropriate choice from the provided schema.
### Result ###
["Prostate"]
