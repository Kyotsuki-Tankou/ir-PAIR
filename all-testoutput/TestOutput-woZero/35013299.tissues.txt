### Keywords ###
From the abstract, terms like "foot," "forearm," "peripheral blood mononuclear cells," "skin," and "wound" suggest involvement of multiple tissues. Specifically, "foot," "forearm," and "skin" are directly mentioned, which correspond to 'Skin' in the schema. Additionally, "peripheral blood mononuclear cells" suggest involvement of 'Blood'.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "profile 174,962 single cells from the foot, forearm, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells," which directly verifies the involvement of 'Skin' (for foot and forearm) and 'Blood' (for peripheral blood mononuclear cells). The focus on wound healing in the context of diabetic foot ulceration further emphasizes the role of 'Skin'.
### Context ###
The detailed description of profiling cells from the foot and forearm, along with the emphasis on wound healing and skin-related processes, solidifies 'Skin' as a primary tissue of interest. The mention of peripheral blood mononuclear cells adds 'Blood' to the list of relevant tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear and consistent focus on foot, forearm, and skin-related processes, as well as the inclusion of blood cells, we conclude that 'Skin' and 'Blood' are the appropriate tissues identified in the input.
### Result ###
['Skin', 'Blood']
