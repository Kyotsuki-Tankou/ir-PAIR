### Keywords ###
From the Keywords "mouse organogenesis," "development," and "spatial transcriptomics," it suggests that 'Embryo development' or 'Normal atlas' might be relevant diseases.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, phrases like "mammalian embryogenesis," "mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA)," and "normal and abnormal mammalian development" strongly indicate that 'Embryo development' is a proper result.
### Context ###
Upon reviewing the context, there are no additional clues that would suggest another disease as the primary focus. The entire abstract centers around the development of the mouse embryo and the creation of a transcriptomic atlas.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Embryo development' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Embryo development']
