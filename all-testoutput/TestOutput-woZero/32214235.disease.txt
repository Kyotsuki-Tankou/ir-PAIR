### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "single-cell mRNA sequencing" and "human cell landscape (HCL)" suggest a focus on human biology and cellular analysis, but do not directly mention a specific disease.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs" and "construct a scheme for the human cell landscape (HCL)," which indicates a broad study of human cells rather than focusing on a specific disease.
### Context ###
Since the study is about creating a comprehensive single-cell atlas of human organs and comparing human and mouse cell landscapes, it does not focus on any specific disease but rather on normal human biology.
### Conclusion ###
Given the lack of mention of any specific disease and the focus on normal human cell landscapes, the most appropriate result is 'Normal'.
### Result ###
['Normal']
