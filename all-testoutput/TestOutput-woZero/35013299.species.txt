###Keywords###
From the input, the term "DFU patients" and the context of human medical conditions such as "diabetic foot ulceration" suggest that 'Homo sapiens' is the species involved.
###Verify###
- The abstract mentions "DFU patients" and "single cells from the foot, forearm, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells," which are all human-specific contexts.
- The study involves human patients with diabetic foot ulceration, further verifying that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the terms and conditions described are clearly human-specific.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as our final result based on the clear and direct mentions in the Abstract.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
