### Keywords ###
From the phrases "single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing" and "ultrahigh-resolution Seq-Scope analyses" in the Abstract, it suggests that 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and 'Seq-Scope' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
1. **scRNA**: The Abstract mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing," which directly aligns with the 'scRNA' technology.
2. **Spatial Transcriptomics**: The mention of "spatial RNA sequencing" indicates the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technology.
3. **Seq-Scope**: The phrase "ultrahigh-resolution Seq-Scope analyses" directly refers to the 'Seq-Scope' technology.
### Context ###
The context of the study involves combining different sequencing technologies to analyze acne lesions, specifically highlighting the use of single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing along with Seq-Scope. This context supports the inclusion of all three technologies without introducing any conflicting information.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and 'Seq-Scope' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'Seq-Scope']
