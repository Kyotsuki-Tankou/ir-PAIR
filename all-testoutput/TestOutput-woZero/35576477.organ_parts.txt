### Keywords ###
From the input, the focus is on "Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM)" and "myocardium." This suggests that the relevant organ part might be related to the heart, specifically the myocardium.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "transmural epicardial-to-endocardial gene expression atlases of explanted ACM hearts" and "fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium," which directly indicate the involvement of the myocardium.
### Context ###
Given the specific context of "ACM hearts" and the detailed description of processes occurring within the myocardium, there is strong contextual evidence that the study pertains to the myocardium.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Myocardium' as the final result based on the keywords, verification, and contextual clues.
### Result ###
['Myocardium']
