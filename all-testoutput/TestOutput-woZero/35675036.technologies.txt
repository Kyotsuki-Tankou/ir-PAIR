### Keywords ###
From the input, the keyword that stands out is "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)." This suggests that 'scRNA' or 'RNA-seq' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "deep single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" multiple times, directly verifying that this technology was used in the study. This supports that 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq' are proper results.
### Context ###
Since the verification step directly confirms the use of scRNA-seq without ambiguity, there is no need for additional context to clarify the technology used.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm that 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq' are the appropriate technologies based on the given input.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'RNA-seq']
