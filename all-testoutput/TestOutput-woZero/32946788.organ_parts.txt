###Keywords###
From the Keywords, potential organ parts include 'Embryo' and 'AGM region'. 
###Verify###
From the Abstract:
- "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region."
- "Studies of model organisms defined intersecting signaling pathways that converge to promote HSC emergence predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta."
- "Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells."
These phrases directly mention 'Embryo' and 'AGM region', verifying their relevance.
###Context###
The context confirms that both 'Embryo' and 'AGM region' are central to the study's focus on HSC development.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm both 'Embryo' and 'AGM region' as relevant organ parts.
###Result###
['Embryo', 'AGM region']
