### Keywords ###
- "cerebellar granule neurons (GNs)"
- "cerebellum"
- "granule neuron progenitors (GNPs)"
- "medulloblastoma"
- "single-cell RNA sequencing of murine cerebellar cells"
- "spatial transcriptomics technology enabled visualization of their spatial locations in cerebellum"
### Verify ###
- The abstract mentions "cerebellar neurogenesis" and "development of the cerebellum," which directly relate to the cerebellum.
- "single-cell RNA sequencing of 24,919 murine cerebellar cells" and "spatial transcriptomics technology enabled visualization of their spatial locations in cerebellum" confirm the focus on the cerebellum.
- The study involves "medulloblastoma," a type of brain tumor typically located in the cerebellum.
### Context ###
- The detailed discussion of "cerebellar granule neurons" and "granule neuron progenitors" within the context of the cerebellum further supports the focus on this specific brain region.
- The use of "Math1-GFP; Dcx-DsRed mice" for single-cell RNA sequencing specifically targets cerebellar cells, reinforcing the cerebellum as the primary organ part studied.
### Conclusion ###
Given the consistent focus on the cerebellum throughout the abstract, we can confidently conclude that 'Cerebellum' is the correct organ part.
### Result ###
['Cerebellum']
