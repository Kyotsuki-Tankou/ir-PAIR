### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "stress granules" and "subcellular localization" are prominently mentioned. This suggests that 'Stress granules' may be a relevant result.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "Transcripts in these complexes localize to specific regions of the cell and can condense into non-membrane-bound structures such as stress granules."
This directly verifies the presence of 'Stress granules' in the context of the study.
### Context ###
Given the direct mention of stress granules and the focus on their RNA composition and spatial organization, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Stress granules' as the appropriate result based on the explicit references in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Stress granules']
