###Keywords###
From the input, the term "APEX-seq" is explicitly mentioned as a method for RNA sequencing.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2." This directly verifies that "APEX-seq" is a technology used in the study.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention and detailed description of "APEX-seq" in the abstract, it is clear that this technology is relevant and used in the study.
###Result###
['APEX-seq']
