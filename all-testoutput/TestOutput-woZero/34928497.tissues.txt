### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "prostate tissue," "prostate luminal cells," "prostates from 5ARI-treated men," and "benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)" suggest that the study is focused on the prostate. Therefore, 'Prostate' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "peri-urethral prostate tissue," "enlarged prostates," and "prostate secretory luminal cells," which further verifies that 'Prostate' is indeed a relevant tissue type in this context.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on prostate-related conditions such as BPH and the specific cellular changes in prostate tissue due to 5ARI treatment, there is no need for additional context to confirm the relevance of 'Prostate'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Prostate' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on prostate tissue and its cellular responses throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Prostate']
