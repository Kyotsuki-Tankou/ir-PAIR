### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "Pathophysiology" and "Transcriptomics" suggest a focus on disease-related studies. The Abstract mentions "mouse and human kidneys" and specific disease models such as "diabetic kidney disease" and "toxic proteinopathy," indicating that 'Kidney' and related diseases like 'Diabetic kidney disease' and 'Kidney injury' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
From the Abstract:
1. "We applied Slide-seqV2 to mouse and human kidneys" directly verifies that 'Kidney' is a primary tissue of focus.
2. "in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease" verifies the presence of 'Diabetic kidney disease'.
3. "in a mouse model of a toxic proteinopathy" suggests a form of 'Kidney injury'.
### Context ###
Since the Abstract clearly mentions specific kidney-related diseases and the Keywords support the general theme of pathophysiology, there is no ambiguity in identifying the relevant diseases.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Kidney', 'Diabetic kidney disease', and 'Kidney injury' as the appropriate disease types based on the given input.
### Result ###
['Kidney', 'Diabetic kidney disease', 'Kidney injury']
