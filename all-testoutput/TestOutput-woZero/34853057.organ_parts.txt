###Keywords###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "intestinal epithelium", "small intestine", "colon", "tuft cells", and "intestinal progenitor cells". These keywords suggest a focus on the intestinal system, particularly the small intestine and colon.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "Tuft cells residing in the intestinal epithelium"
- "In the small intestine, they provide protection against inflammation"
- "In the colon, they had been implicated in tumourigenesis"
- "Commitment of intestinal progenitor cells to the tuft cell lineage"
These points verify that the study is deeply involved in understanding the functions and regulation of tuft cells within the small intestine and colon.
###Context###
While the abstract does not explicitly use the terms "Small intestine" and "Colon" separately in the context of organ parts, the detailed discussion of tuft cells' roles and the impact of DDX5 in both the small intestine and colon indicates a clear focus on these specific regions of the intestine.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention and detailed study of the small intestine and colon, both "Small intestine" and "Colon" are appropriate matches from the schema.
###Result###
['Small intestine', 'Colon']
