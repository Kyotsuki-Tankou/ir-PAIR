###Keywords###
From the Keywords "mouse" and "bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells," it suggests that 'Mus musculus' might be the relevant species.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, phrases like "young, adult and aging mice" and "we computationally defined mesenchymal progenitors at different stages and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult and aging mice" strongly indicate that 'Mus musculus' is the species used in the study.
###Context###
Upon reviewing the context, there are no additional clues that would suggest another species as the primary focus. The entire abstract centers around studies conducted on mice.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Mus musculus' as our final result.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
