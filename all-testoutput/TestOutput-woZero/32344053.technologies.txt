### Keywords ###
- **Olink proteomics**
- **Atopic dermatitis**
- **Single-cell RNA sequencing**
- **Suction blistering**
### Verify ###
- **Olink proteomics**: Mentioned explicitly in the keywords.
- **Atopic dermatitis**: Mentioned as the primary focus of the study in the background and objective sections.
- **Single-cell RNA sequencing**: Mentioned in the methods section as a technique used to compare transcriptional profiles.
- **Suction blistering**: Mentioned as the method used for sampling skin cells and interstitial fluid.
### Context ###
- The abstract clearly outlines the use of single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze transcriptomic data and Olink proteomics for proteomic data in the context of atopic dermatitis.
- Suction blistering is described as a method for sampling, which is relevant to the study's methodology but not directly a technology listed in the schema.
- The focus on atopic dermatitis aligns with the disease aspect, but since we are extracting technologies, we will focus on the technical methods used.
### Conclusion ###
- Based on the explicit mentions and the context provided, the technologies used in the study are 'Single-cell RNA sequencing' and 'Olink proteomics'.
- 'Suction blistering' is a method rather than a technology listed in the schema, so it will not be included in the final result.
### Result ###
['Single-cell RNA sequencing', 'Olink proteomics']
