### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, we can identify terms like "mammalian cells," "hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs)," "retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt+(RORγt+) γδ T cell," "interleukin-17A (IL-17A)," "Protein kinase B (AKT)," "extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)," and "mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)." These terms suggest a focus on mammalian cellular processes and signaling pathways.
### Verify ###
The Abstract explicitly mentions "mammalian cells" and various mammalian-specific signaling pathways and cell types, such as γδ T cells and interleukin-17A. This context strongly indicates that the study is focused on mammalian species.
### Context ###
Given the repeated and explicit mention of "mammalian cells" and mammalian-specific biological processes, it is clear that the study is centered on a mammalian model. The specific species is not directly mentioned, but the general term "mammalian" aligns with several species in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context provided by the Abstract, we can conclude that the study is relevant to mammalian species. Among the options provided in the schema, "Mus musculus" (mouse) is a commonly used mammalian model in such studies, but without specific mention, we should generalize to "mammalian" rather than specifying a particular species.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus'] (assuming the common mammalian model used in such research, though "Homo sapiens" could also be considered if human cells were implied)
