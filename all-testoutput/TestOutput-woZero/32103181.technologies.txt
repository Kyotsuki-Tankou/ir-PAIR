### Keywords ###
- "deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors" suggests technologies like 'scRNA' and possibly 'scATAC-seq' if considering chromatin accessibility.
- "survey the profiles of various populations of T cells and T cell receptors" implies detailed transcriptomic analysis.
### Verify ###
- "single-cell sequencing of RNA" directly points to 'scRNA'.
- The mention of "T cell receptors" could imply a need for detailed transcriptomic and possibly epigenetic analysis, but the primary focus is on RNA sequencing.
### Context ###
- The abstract emphasizes "deep single-cell sequencing of RNA," which strongly indicates the use of single-cell RNA sequencing technology.
- There is no explicit mention of other technologies like 'scATAC-seq', and the focus remains on RNA analysis.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the strong emphasis on single-cell RNA sequencing and the absence of conflicting information, 'scRNA' is confirmed as the relevant technology used in the study.
### Result ###
['scRNA']
