### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "prostate cancer" is explicitly mentioned, suggesting that 'Homo sapiens' may be a proper result, as prostate cancer is specific to humans.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in men worldwide"
- "we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on prostate biopsies, prostatectomy specimens, and patient-derived organoids from localized prostate cancer patients"
These statements clearly indicate that the study is conducted on human subjects, verifying 'Homo sapiens' as the relevant species.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the study is on human subjects, there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
