###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we have "brain region delineation and identification", "postnatal mouse brain development", "single cell", "spatial transcriptomics", and "stereo-seq". These terms suggest a focus on the brain and its development in mice.
###Verify###
Without an abstract, we rely solely on the Keywords. The terms "brain region delineation and identification" and "postnatal mouse brain development" strongly indicate a focus on different parts of the brain.
###Context###
Given the focus on brain regions and development, we need to determine if these terms correspond to any specific items in the provided schema. The schema includes various brain-related terms such as "Striatum", "Coronal brain section", "Hypothalamus", "Olfactory bulb", "Medulla", "Whole Mouse Bladder", "Coronal Brain", "Lumbar spinal cord (L3/L4)", "Hippocampus", "Frontal cortex", "Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex", "Human cortex", "Cortex", etc.
###Conclusion###
While the Keywords suggest a broad focus on the brain, they do not specify particular regions that directly match the schema items. However, given the context of brain region delineation and development, it is reasonable to infer that multiple brain-related terms from the schema could be relevant.
###Result###
['Striatum', 'Coronal brain section', 'Hypothalamus', 'Olfactory bulb', 'Medulla', 'Coronal Brain', 'Lumbar spinal cord (L3/L4)', 'Hippocampus', 'Frontal cortex', 'Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex', 'Human cortex', 'Cortex']
