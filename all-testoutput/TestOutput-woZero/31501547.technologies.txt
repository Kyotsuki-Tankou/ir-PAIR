###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "high-definition spatial transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "Here, we developed high-definition spatial transcriptomics, which captures RNA from histological tissue sections on a dense, spatially barcoded bead array," which directly verifies the use of a technology related to 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
###Conclusion###
Since the term 'high-definition spatial transcriptomics' is both mentioned in the keywords and clearly verified in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is the appropriate technology used, given that "high-definition" is a specific enhancement of the general 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technology.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
