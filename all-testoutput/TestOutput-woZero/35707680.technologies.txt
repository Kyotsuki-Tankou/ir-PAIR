###Keywords###
From the input, the term "Visium spatial transcriptomics" is mentioned, which suggests that '10x Visium' or 'Spatial Transcriptomics' might be relevant technologies according to the schema.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically states:
- "We present a protocol to localize T cell receptor clones using the Visium spatial transcriptomics platform."
This statement clearly indicates that the 'Visium spatial transcriptomics' platform is being used, which corresponds to '10x Visium' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' in the schema.
###Context###
The context further supports this as the abstract discusses the localization of gene expression and T cell clonotypes in situ within tissue sections, which aligns with the capabilities of spatial transcriptomics technologies.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention and context, we can conclude that both '10x Visium' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are appropriate technologies to be extracted according to the schema.
###Result###
['10x Visium', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
