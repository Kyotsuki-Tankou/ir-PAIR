###Keywords###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "mouse organogenesis," "spatial transcriptomics," "single-cell resolution," and "developing tissues." These keywords suggest a focus on mammalian development, specifically in mice.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA)"
- "maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis"
- "gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain"
These points verify that the study is focused on the development processes in mice, particularly during organogenesis.
###Context###
The abstract does not mention any other species besides mice. The focus is entirely on "mouse organogenesis" and the creation of a transcriptomic atlas for mice.
###Conclusion###
Given the exclusive focus on mouse development and organogenesis, "Mus musculus" is the most appropriate match from the provided schema.
###Result###
["Mus musculus"]
