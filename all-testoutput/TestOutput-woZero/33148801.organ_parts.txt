###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "skeletal muscle of mice" and "myofibers" suggest that 'Skeletal muscle (quadriceps)' might be a relevant organ part, given the context of muscle disorder and the mouse model used.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "single-nucleus transcriptomics of skeletal muscle of mice with dystrophin exon 51 deletion," which directly indicates the focus on skeletal muscle, particularly in a mouse model. This verifies that 'Skeletal muscle (quadriceps)' is a relevant organ part, as quadriceps is a common skeletal muscle studied in mouse models.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Skeletal muscle (quadriceps)' as our final result.
###Result###
['Skeletal muscle (quadriceps)']
