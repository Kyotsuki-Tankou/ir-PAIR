### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the key terms related to tissues are "mouse embryo," "inner cell mass," "epiblast," "germ layers," "cell lineages," "gastrulation," and "visceral endoderm."
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo"
- "descendants of the inner cell mass in the early epiblast"
- "formation of the germ layers"
- "cell lineages are specified"
- "gastrulation stages"
- "visceral endoderm"
These terms suggest a focus on early embryonic development, particularly involving the "Embryo" and "Gastrula."
### Context ###
Given the context of the study:
- The study is centered around the early stages of mouse embryo development.
- It involves the transition from naive to primed pluripotent states.
- The formation and regionalization of germ layers are key aspects.
- The mention of "visceral endoderm" and its contribution to the endoderm indicates a focus on early embryonic tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords and context, the relevant tissues from the schema that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned are "Embryo" and "Gastrula."
### Result ###
["Embryo", "Gastrula"]
