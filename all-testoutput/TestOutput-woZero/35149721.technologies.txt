### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "spatial transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, which directly corresponds to one of the technologies in the schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to define how the transcriptomic landscape is spatially organized in the steady state and healing murine colon." This clearly indicates the use of "Spatial Transcriptomics" technology.
### Context ###
The context of the study involves mapping the transcriptomic landscape in the colon using spatial transcriptomics, both in steady state and during healing. This further reinforces the use of "Spatial Transcriptomics" technology, as no other technology mentioned in the schema is directly related to the described methods.
### Conclusion ###
Given the direct mention and the context aligning with the use of spatial transcriptomics, we can confidently conclude that "Spatial Transcriptomics" is the appropriate technology to be extracted.
### Result ###
["Spatial Transcriptomics"]
