### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics." These suggest that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' might be relevant technologies.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "profile 174,962 single cells from the foot, forearm, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-cell RNA sequencing"
- "analysis of spatially separated samples from the same patient and spatial transcriptomics"
This directly verifies that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are indeed relevant technologies.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify these technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
