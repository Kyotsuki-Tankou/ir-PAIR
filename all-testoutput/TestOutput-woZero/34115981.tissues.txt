### Keywords ###
From the abstract and keywords, the following tissues are mentioned directly or implied:
- 'Colon'
- 'Liver'
- 'Subcellular architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm' (implies 'Cell line' or 'Epithelium')
### Verify ###
- "tissue zonation according to the portal-central (liver)" explicitly mentions 'Liver'.
- "crypt-surface (colon)" explicitly mentions 'Colon'.
- "subcellular architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm" suggests detailed cellular analysis, which could involve 'Cell line' or 'Epithelium'.
### Context ###
To ensure accuracy:
- The mention of "tissue sections" and specific axes like "portal-central" and "crypt-surface" confirms the focus on 'Liver' and 'Colon'.
- The subcellular analysis could indeed relate to 'Cell line' or 'Epithelium', but without specific mention of a cell line, 'Epithelium' is more broadly applicable.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mentions and the context of the study, the relevant tissues are 'Colon', 'Liver', and 'Epithelium'.
### Result ###
['Colon', 'Liver', 'Epithelium']
