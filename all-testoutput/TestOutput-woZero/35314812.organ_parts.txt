### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse brain," "kidney," and "ductal carcinoma in situ tissues" are prominent, indicating potential organ parts such as 'Brain,' 'Kidney,' and 'Breast Cancer.'
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "mouse brain and kidney datasets"
- "two ductal carcinoma in situ tissues"
These mentions directly verify the presence of 'Brain,' 'Kidney,' and 'Breast Cancer' as the organ parts involved in the study.
### Context ###
The context is clear as the abstract explicitly states the tissues analyzed:
- Mouse brain and kidney for benchmarking CellTrek.
- Ductal carcinoma in situ tissues for applying CellTrek to identify tumor subclones.
There is no ambiguity in the context that would require further clarification.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear and direct mentions in the abstract, we can conclusively verify 'Brain,' 'Kidney,' and 'Breast Cancer' as the organ parts involved.
### Result ###
['Brain', 'Kidney', 'Breast Cancer']
