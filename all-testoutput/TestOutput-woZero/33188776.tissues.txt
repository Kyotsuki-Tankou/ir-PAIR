### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "mouse embryos," "brain," and "pigmented epithelium in an eye field." This suggests that 'Embryo,' 'Brain,' and 'Eye' might be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis"
- "fine features like microvasculature in a brain"
- "pigmented epithelium in an eye field"
This directly verifies that 'Embryo,' 'Brain,' and 'Eye' are indeed relevant tissues.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "mouse embryos," "brain," and "eye field," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify these tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Embryo,' 'Brain,' and 'Eye' as our final results.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Brain', 'Eye']
