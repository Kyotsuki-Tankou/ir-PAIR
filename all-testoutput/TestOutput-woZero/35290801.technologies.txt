### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "spatial transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
- The abstract states: "Moreover, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased analysis of CRISPR-edited tumors," which directly verifies the presence of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Context ###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific technology used in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final result based on the explicit mention in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
