### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, we have "intestinal development", "mesenchymal cells", "intestinal crypt", and "human development". These terms suggest a focus on the human intestine and related developmental processes.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, we see mentions of "human intestine", "intestinal morphogenesis", "crypt-villus axis formation", "neural, vascular, mesenchymal morphogenesis", and "Peyer's patches and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)". These phrases indicate a specific focus on the human intestine and its development.
### Context ###
Given the specific mention of "human intestine" and related structures like "Peyer's patches" and "GALT", we need to determine if these terms directly correspond to any items in the provided schema. The schema includes terms like "Ileum" and "Colon", which are parts of the intestine.
### Conclusion ###
The terms from the Keywords and the Abstract directly correspond to specific items in the provided schema list. The closest related terms in the schema are "Ileum" and "Colon", which are explicitly related to the intestine.
### Result ###
["Ileum", "Colon"]
