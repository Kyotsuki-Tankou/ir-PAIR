###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "uterine dysfunctions," "fertility disorders," "pregnancy complications," "embryo implantation site," "mouse uterus," "pregnancy day 7.5 (D7.5)," and "spatial transcriptomics" are prominent. These suggest a focus on reproductive health and early pregnancy processes.
###Verify###
Upon reviewing the abstract, we see mentions of:
- "uterine dysfunctions lead to fertility disorders and pregnancy complications."
- "Normal uterine functions at pregnancy depend on crosstalk among multiple cell types in uterine microenvironments."
- "embryo implantation site of the mouse uterus on pregnancy day 7.5 (D7.5)."
These statements indicate a focus on the early stages of pregnancy and the interactions within the uterine environment, particularly around the embryo implantation site.
###Context###
Given the focus on "embryo implantation site" and "uterine microenvironments," we need to consider if any of the schema items could be related to these aspects. The closest potential matches might be "Embryo development," "Embryo implantation site," "Early Pregnancy," and "Normal atlas."
###Conclusion###
The abstract clearly focuses on the embryo implantation site and the associated uterine microenvironments during early pregnancy. Therefore, the most relevant disease or condition from the schema would be "Embryo implantation site" and "Early Pregnancy."
###Result###
["Embryo implantation site", "Early Pregnancy"]
