###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "Arabidopsis leaves" and "leaf" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Leaf' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Here, we present scStereo-seq (single-cell spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) that enabled us to show the bona fide single-cell spatial transcriptome profiles of Arabidopsis leaves."
- "Subtle but significant transcriptomic differences between upper and lower epidermal cells have been successfully distinguished."
- "Furthermore, we discovered cell-type-specific gene expression gradients from the main vein to the leaf edge."
These statements clearly verify the focus on 'Leaf' as the organ part studied in the research.
###Context###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the study of 'Leaf', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Leaf' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['Leaf']
