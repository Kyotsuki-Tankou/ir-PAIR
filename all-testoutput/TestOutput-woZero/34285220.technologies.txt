### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "PIC" (photo-isolation chemistry) is prominently mentioned multiple times, indicating that it is a key technology used in the study.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Here, we establish a transcriptome profiling method coupled with photo-isolation chemistry (PIC)..."
- "PIC uses photo-caged oligodeoxynucleotides for in situ reverse transcription."
- "PIC transcriptome analysis detects genes specifically expressed in small distinct areas..."
These statements clearly verify that "PIC" is the primary technology employed in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear and repeated mention of "PIC" in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that "PIC" is the appropriate technology to be extracted according to the schema.
### Result ###
["PIC"]
