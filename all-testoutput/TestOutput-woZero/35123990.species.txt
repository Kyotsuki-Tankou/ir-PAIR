### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "keloids" and "normal skin control" are mentioned, indicating a focus on human skin conditions. The study involves "patient-matched keloid and normal mature scar," which further suggests human subjects.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions "keloid tissue samples and normal skin control data" and "patient-matched keloid and normal mature scar," which clearly indicates that the study is conducted on human tissue. Additionally, the use of "single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics" on these samples further verifies the involvement of human subjects.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on human keloid tissue and normal skin, there is no need for additional context to confirm the species involved. The study's emphasis on human-specific conditions and tissues leaves little room for ambiguity.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on human tissue and conditions throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
