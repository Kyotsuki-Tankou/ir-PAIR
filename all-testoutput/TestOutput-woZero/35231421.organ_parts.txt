### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and "tumor" are directly mentioned, indicating that 'Renal pelvis', 'ccRCC tumor', or 'Kidney' may be relevant organ parts.
### Verify ###
From the Abstract, "we used spatial transcriptomics to examine the nature of B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and "TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity," we can verify that the study focuses on renal cell carcinoma, which is primarily associated with the kidney.
### Context ###
The context of the study revolves around renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which is a type of kidney cancer. The mention of "tumor beds" and "renal cell carcinoma" specifically points towards kidney-related tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Given the specific focus on renal cell carcinoma and the association with kidney tissues, 'Renal pelvis' and 'ccRCC tumor' are more precise terms related to the study's focus.
### Result ###
['Renal pelvis', 'ccRCC tumor']
