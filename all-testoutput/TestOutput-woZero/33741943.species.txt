###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "chicken heart" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Gallus gallus' (the scientific name for chicken) may be a proper result.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with algorithms for data integration to study the development of the chicken heart," which directly verifies the presence of 'Gallus gallus'.
###Context###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific species (chicken) involved in the study.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Gallus gallus' as our final result based on the explicit mention in the abstract.
###Result###
