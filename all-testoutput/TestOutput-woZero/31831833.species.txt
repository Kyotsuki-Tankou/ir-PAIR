###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients" and "spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients" suggest the involvement of human subjects. This indicates that 'Homo sapiens' may be the proper result.
###Verify###
- The mention of "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients" and "spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients" in the Abstract directly points to human subjects.
- The context of studying human synovial tissue biopsies further supports this.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the terms "RA patients" and "SpA patients" clearly specify the species involved.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as our final result based on the clear and direct mentions in the Abstract.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
