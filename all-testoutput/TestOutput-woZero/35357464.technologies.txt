### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the technologies mentioned are "spatial transcriptomics" and "single-cell RNA-seq."
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "we performed the spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq assays"
- "The spatial transcriptomic annotation identified 11 domains of distinct gene signatures"
- "The scRNA-Seq identified 12 types of cells in the D7.5 uterus"
These statements clearly verify the use of "Spatial Transcriptomics" and "scRNA" technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention and detailed description of both "spatial transcriptomics" and "single-cell RNA-seq" in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that these are the technologies used in the study.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA']
