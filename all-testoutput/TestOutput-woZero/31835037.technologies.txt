### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the technologies mentioned are "single-cell RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "in situ sequencing."
### Verify ###
- "single-cell RNA sequencing" corresponds to 'scRNA'.
- "spatial transcriptomics" corresponds to 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- "in situ sequencing" is not explicitly listed in the schema, but it is closely related to 'seqFISH' and 'seqFISH+' which are types of in situ sequencing techniques.
### Context ###
The abstract does not mention any other specific technologies from the schema. The terms "single-cell RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "in situ sequencing" are clearly stated and directly correspond to the technologies listed in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords and the context, the technologies used in the study are 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and potentially 'seqFISH' or 'seqFISH+' due to the mention of "in situ sequencing."
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'seqFISH']
