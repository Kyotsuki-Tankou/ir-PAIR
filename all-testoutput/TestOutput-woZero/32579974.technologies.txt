### Keywords ###
From the Keywords section, the relevant technologies mentioned are "scRNA-seq" and "spatial transcriptomics."
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, it is mentioned:
- "combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics"
This directly verifies that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are indeed relevant technologies.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify these technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we confirm 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
