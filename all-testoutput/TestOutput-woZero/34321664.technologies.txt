### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" stand out as specific technologies mentioned. This suggests that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
- The phrase "single-cell RNA sequencing" directly verifies that 'scRNA' is indeed a proper result.
- The phrase "spatial transcriptomics" directly verifies that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is also a proper result.
### Context ###
No additional context is needed as the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" clearly specify the technologies used without ambiguity.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results based on the clear and direct mentions in the Abstract.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
