### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be relevant technologies.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics."
These statements clearly verify the use of 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technologies in the study.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as the final results based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
