### Keywords ###
From the "Abstract," the keywords that stand out are "skeletal muscle," "mouse skeletal muscle," "myogenesis," and "muscle repair." These suggest that 'Skeletal muscle' might be a relevant organ part.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "Single-cell gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical for muscle repair."
- "We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle."
- "We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle at three time points after injury."
These statements directly verify that 'Skeletal muscle' is indeed the relevant organ part.
### Context ###
The context further supports this:
- The study focuses on "myogenic stem and progenitor cells" which are key components of skeletal muscle.
- The mention of "mouse skeletal muscle" and "muscle injury response" aligns with the functions and characteristics of skeletal muscle.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit focus on "skeletal muscle" throughout the abstract, it is clear that 'Skeletal muscle' is the correct organ part relevant to this study.
### Result ###
['Skeletal muscle']
