### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the terms "colorectal cancer (CRC)" and "liver metastases" suggest a focus on human-related research. The mention of "patients" and "therapeutic options" further implies that the study involves human subjects.
### Verify ###
The Abstract states:
- "Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients."
- "the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood."
- "Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution..."
These statements clearly indicate that the study is conducted on human subjects, specifically focusing on colorectal cancer and liver metastases in humans.
### Context ###
Since the Abstract consistently refers to human patients and human-specific conditions (CRC and liver metastases), there is no need for additional context to verify the species.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear and consistent information provided in the Abstract, we can confidently conclude that the species involved in the study is 'Homo sapiens'.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
