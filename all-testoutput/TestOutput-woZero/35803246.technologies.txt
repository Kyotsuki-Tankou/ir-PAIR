### Keywords ###
From the abstract, keywords such as "single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq," "spatial single-cell transcriptomics," "TCR-seq," "RNA/ATAC-seq," and "multiplexed imaging" are prominent. These terms suggest the use of specific technologies for analysis.
### Verify ###
- "single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq" directly matches 'RNA-seq' and 'snRNA'.
- "spatial single-cell transcriptomics" suggests technologies like 'Spatial Transcriptomics' or 'Slide-seq'.
- "TCR-seq" is not directly listed in the schema but is a type of sequencing technology.
- "RNA/ATAC-seq" matches 'RNA-seq' and 'scATAC-seq'.
- "multiplexed imaging" is not directly listed in the schema but implies advanced imaging techniques possibly related to some of the spatial technologies.
### Context ###
Given the mention of "single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq," "spatial single-cell transcriptomics," and "RNA/ATAC-seq," we can infer the use of several sequencing and imaging technologies. The context supports the presence of these technologies in the study, aligning with the keywords identified.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions and the context provided, the technologies used in the study that match the schema include 'RNA-seq,' 'snRNA,' 'Spatial Transcriptomics,' and 'scATAC-seq.'
### Result ###
['RNA-seq', 'snRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scATAC-seq']
