### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the following technologies are mentioned or implied:
- "Single-cell sequencing"
- "spatial transcriptomics"
- "single-nuclear sequencing"
- "multiplexed CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) immunofluorescence"
### Verify ###
- "Single-cell sequencing" can be associated with 'scRNA-seq' or 'scATAC-seq'.
- "spatial transcriptomics" directly matches 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- "single-nuclear sequencing" can be associated with 'snRNA-seq'.
- "multiplexed CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) immunofluorescence" is a specific technique but not directly listed in the schema.
### Context ###
- The abstract mentions "optimized coordination of spatial transcriptomics and single-nuclear sequencing data sets," which strongly suggests the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and 'snRNA-seq'.
- "Single-cell sequencing" is a broad term that can encompass several technologies, but given the context of kidney cell type characterization and spatial distribution, 'scRNA-seq' is a likely match.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context and direct mentions, the technologies used in the study are:
- 'Spatial Transcriptomics'
- 'snRNA-seq'
- 'scRNA-seq'
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'snRNA-seq', 'scRNA-seq']
