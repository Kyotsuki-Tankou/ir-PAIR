###Keywords###
From the input, the term "Seq-Scope" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Seq-Scope' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Here, we report Seq-Scope, a spatial barcoding technology with a resolution comparable to an optical microscope."
- "Seq-Scope is based on a solid-phase amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule oligonucleotides using an Illumina sequencing platform."
These statements clearly verify the use of 'Seq-Scope' technology in the study.
###Context###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'Seq-Scope', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Seq-Scope' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['Seq-Scope']
