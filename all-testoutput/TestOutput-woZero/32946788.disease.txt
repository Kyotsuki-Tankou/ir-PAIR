### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "HSC," "embryo," and "hematopoiesis" suggest a focus on early developmental processes and hematopoietic systems. "Embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region" indicates a specific developmental context, which may relate to 'Embryo development' or 'Hematopoiesis' in the schema.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region" and "to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development." This directly verifies that the study focuses on the early development of HSCs, which aligns with 'Embryo development' and 'Hematopoiesis.'
### Context ###
Since both the Abstract and Keywords clearly emphasize the developmental aspect of HSCs in the AGM region, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Embryo development' and 'Hematopoiesis' as our final results based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the Abstract and Keywords.
### Result ###
['Embryo development', 'Hematopoiesis']
