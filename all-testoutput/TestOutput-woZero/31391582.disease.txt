### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, terms like "post-implantation development," "mouse embryo," "epiblast," "germ layers," "gastrulation," and "lineage specification" suggest a focus on early embryonic development.
### Verify ###
The Abstract specifically mentions "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "germ layers," and "gastrulation," which strongly indicate a focus on embryonic development processes.
### Context ###
The context provided by the Abstract emphasizes the study of early embryonic stages, particularly the transition from naive to primed pluripotent states and the formation of germ layers during gastrulation. This aligns with processes related to embryonic development.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear focus on early embryonic stages and the formation of germ layers, we can conclude that the relevant disease or condition in this context is 'Embryo development.'
### Result ###
['Embryo development']
