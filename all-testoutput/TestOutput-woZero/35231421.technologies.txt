### Keywords ###
From the Keywords "Visium; spatial transcriptomics," it indicates that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and possibly '10x Visium' may be relevant technologies used in the study.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "we used spatial transcriptomics to examine the nature of B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)," which directly verifies the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'. Additionally, the mention of "Visium" in the keywords suggests the use of '10x Visium', a specific platform for spatial transcriptomics.
### Context ###
Given that '10x Visium' is a specific implementation of spatial transcriptomics, the mention of both terms in the keywords and the context of the study strongly supports the use of both technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose both 'Spatial Transcriptomics' and '10x Visium' as our final results based on the context and direct mentions.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', '10x Visium']
