### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "Single-cell RNA sequencing", "spatial information", "landmark genes", "ClumpSeq", and "spatially-resolved tissue cell atlases". These keywords suggest a focus on advanced sequencing technologies and spatial transcriptomics.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "Single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial information"
- "ClumpSeq, an approach for sequencing small clumps of attached cells"
- "establish spatial atlases for all epithelial cell types in the small intestine"
These points verify that the study employs a novel sequencing approach, ClumpSeq, to achieve spatially-resolved tissue cell atlases.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of "ClumpSeq" as the primary technology used in the study, we can confidently conclude that "ClumpSeq" is the correct technology to be extracted.
### Result ###
['ClumpSeq']
