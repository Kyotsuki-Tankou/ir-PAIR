###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH)" is prominently mentioned, indicating that 'EASI-FISH' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We developed Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to survey gene expression in brain tissue," and "Using the EASI-FISH pipeline, we investigated the spatial distribution of dozens of molecularly defined cell types in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)." This further verifies that 'EASI-FISH' is indeed the technology used in the study.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'EASI-FISH' as our final result.
###Result###
['EASI-FISH']
