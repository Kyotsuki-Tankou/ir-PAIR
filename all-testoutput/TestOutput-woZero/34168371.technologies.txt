### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the terms "single-cell and spatial sequencing" are mentioned, suggesting the use of technologies related to single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
### Verify ###
The Abstract states, "we investigated the single-cell phenotypes associated with antimicrobial responses in human leprosy granulomas by applying single-cell and spatial sequencing to leprosy biopsy specimens." This indicates the use of technologies that can perform both single-cell and spatial sequencing.
### Context ###
Given that "single-cell and spatial sequencing" are mentioned together, we need to consider technologies that can perform both functions. From the schema, "scRNA-seq" (single-cell RNA sequencing) and "Spatial Transcriptomics" are relevant technologies that fit this description.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context and the described methodology, it is reasonable to infer that "scRNA-seq" and "Spatial Transcriptomics" are the technologies used, as they align with the capabilities described in the Abstract.
### Result ###
["scRNA-seq", "Spatial Transcriptomics"]
