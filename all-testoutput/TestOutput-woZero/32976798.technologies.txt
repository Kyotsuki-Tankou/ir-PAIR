###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "scRNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics" directly indicate the technologies used. These terms suggest that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
###Verify###
- From "scRNA sequencing" in the Abstract, we can verify that 'scRNA' is indeed a proper result.
- From "Spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract, we can verify that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is also a proper result.
###Context###
No additional context is needed as the terms "scRNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics" clearly specify the technologies involved.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results based on the clear and direct mentions in the Abstract.
###Result###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
