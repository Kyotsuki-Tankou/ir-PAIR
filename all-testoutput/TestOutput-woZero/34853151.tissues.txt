### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "kidney biology," "female murine model," and "ischemia-reperfusion injury." These suggest that 'Kidney' might be the relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "Single-cell sequencing technologies have advanced our understanding of kidney biology and disease"
- "female bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury model"
- "spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and repair time course"
These statements directly verify that 'Kidney' is indeed the relevant tissue.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "kidney biology" and "ischemia-reperfusion injury model" related to the kidney, there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Kidney' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Kidney']
