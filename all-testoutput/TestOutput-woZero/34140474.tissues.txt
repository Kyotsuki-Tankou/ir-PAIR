###Keywords###
From the abstract, the following tissues are directly mentioned:
- "31 adult pig tissues"
- "47 skeletal muscles"
- "six adipose depots"
- "subcutaneous adipose tissues"
###Verify###
The abstract specifies:
- "transcriptomic survey of pigs"
- "characterize four transcript types (lncRNAs, TUCPs, miRNAs, and circRNAs) and protein-coding genes in 31 adult pig tissues and two cell lines"
- "transcriptomic variability among 47 skeletal muscles, and six adipose depots"
- "comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of seven tissues from pigs and nine other vertebrates"
- "long-range promoter-enhancer interaction analysis in subcutaneous adipose tissues"
###Context###
To ensure accuracy, we need to consider the context:
- The study involves a comprehensive analysis of various tissues, including skeletal muscles and adipose depots.
- The mention of "subcutaneous adipose tissues" indicates a focus on specific types of adipose tissues.
- The comparative analysis across vertebrates suggests a broad examination of tissue specialization.
###Conclusion###
Given the specific mentions and the context, the relevant tissues from the schema that are directly or indirectly referenced include:
- 'Muscle' (due to "47 skeletal muscles")
- 'Skin' (due to "subcutaneous adipose tissues")
- 'Adipose' (though not explicitly listed in the schema, "adipose depots" suggest a focus on adipose tissues, which can be linked to 'Skin' in the context of subcutaneous adipose)
###Result###
['Muscle', 'Skin']
