###Keywords###
From the input, the term "ClumpSeq" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'ClumpSeq' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Here, we present ClumpSeq, an approach for sequencing small clumps of attached cells."
- "ClumpSeq can be applied for reconstructing spatial atlases of rare cell types in other tissues and tumors."
These statements clearly verify the use of 'ClumpSeq' technology in the study.
###Context###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'ClumpSeq', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'ClumpSeq' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['ClumpSeq']
