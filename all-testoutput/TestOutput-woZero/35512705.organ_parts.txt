### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "mouse organogenesis," "dorsal midbrain," and "developing tissues." These suggest that 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Dorsal midbrain' might be relevant organ parts.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA)..."
- "gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain."
These statements verify that 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Dorsal midbrain' are indeed relevant organ parts.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "mouse organogenesis" and "dorsal midbrain," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify these organ parts.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Dorsal midbrain' as our final results.
### Result ###
['Mouse Embryo', 'Dorsal midbrain']
