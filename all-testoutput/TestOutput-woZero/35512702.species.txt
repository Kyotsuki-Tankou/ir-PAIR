### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "Arabidopsis leaves" is prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Arabidopsis thaliana' may be the relevant species.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions "Arabidopsis leaves" and "single-cell gene expression profiling technologies applied to Arabidopsis," which further verifies that 'Arabidopsis thaliana' is indeed the species studied in this context.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on "Arabidopsis leaves" and the use of scStereo-seq to analyze single-cell spatial transcriptome profiles in Arabidopsis, there is no need for additional context to confirm the relevance of 'Arabidopsis thaliana'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Arabidopsis thaliana' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on Arabidopsis throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Arabidopsis thaliana']
