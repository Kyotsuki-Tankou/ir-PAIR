### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq)" stands out as a specific technology mentioned.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly describes the use of DBiT-seq for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in tissue slides, confirming that DBiT-seq is indeed a technology employed in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention and detailed description of DBiT-seq in the abstract, it is evident that DBiT-seq is the technology used.
### Result ###
["DBiT-seq"]
