###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses" suggest that 'RNA-seq', 'scRNA', and potentially other sequencing technologies might be relevant.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly mentions "Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses," which directly verifies the use of 'RNA-seq' and 'scRNA'. There is no mention of other specific technologies from the schema.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mention of "Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses," it is clear that 'RNA-seq' and 'scRNA' are the technologies used in the study.
###Result###
['RNA-seq', 'scRNA']
