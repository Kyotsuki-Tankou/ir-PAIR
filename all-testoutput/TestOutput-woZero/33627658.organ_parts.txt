###Keywords###
- "single-cell combinatorial indexing on Microbiopsies Assigned to Positions for the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin"
- "sciMAP-ATAC"
- "adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex"
- "human primary visual cortex"
- "mouse brain"
###Verify###
- The abstract mentions "sciMAP-ATAC" as a method used for spatially resolved, single-cell profiling of chromatin states.
- It specifies the application of sciMAP-ATAC in "the adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex and in the human primary visual cortex."
- Additionally, it discusses the characterization of cerebral ischemic infarction in "the mouse brain."
###Context###
- The focus is on cortical regions and the brain, specifically mentioning the somatosensory cortex and visual cortex.
- The term "mouse brain" is used in the context of studying cerebral ischemic infarction.
###Conclusion###
- The primary organ parts mentioned and directly related to the experiments are "Cortex" and "Mouse brain."
- "Cortex" is explicitly mentioned in both mouse and human contexts.
- "Mouse brain" is specifically mentioned in relation to the ischemic infarction model.
###Result###
['Cortex', 'Mouse brain']
