### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords "kidney," "ischemia-reperfusion injury," "AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)," and "repair" stand out as relevant to the schema.
### Verify ###
- "female bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury model" suggests "Acute kidney injury."
- "spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and repair time course" indicates a focus on "Kidney injury" and "Tissue repair."
- "injured proximal tubule cells" and "AKI to CKD transition" further confirm the relevance of "Acute kidney injury."
### Context ###
- The abstract discusses a study on kidney injury and repair, specifically focusing on ischemia-reperfusion injury in a murine model.
- The use of spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression during the injury and repair process emphasizes the study's focus on understanding the molecular dynamics of kidney injury and its recovery.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear focus on kidney injury, particularly ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the repair process, the most relevant terms from the schema are "Acute kidney injury" and "Tissue repair."
### Result ###
['Acute kidney injury', 'Tissue repair']
