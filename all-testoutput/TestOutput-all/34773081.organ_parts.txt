###Keywords###
From the Abstract, we can identify key terms such as "skeletal muscle repair," "myogenic stem and progenitor cells," "single-cell gene expression analyses," "mouse skeletal muscle," and "spatial transcriptomic data." These terms strongly suggest a focus on skeletal muscle.
###Verify###
The Abstract explicitly mentions "skeletal muscle repair," "mouse skeletal muscle," and "spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle." These phrases directly indicate that the study is centered around skeletal muscle.
###Conclusion###
Based on the clear and consistent mention of "skeletal muscle" throughout the Abstract, we can confidently conclude that the primary organ part relevant to this study is the skeletal muscle.
###Result###
['Skeletal muscle']
