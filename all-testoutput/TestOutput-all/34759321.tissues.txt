###Keywords###
From the abstract, the following keywords stand out:
- "oral carcinomas"
- "melanoma"
- "mice"
- "tumours"
- "metastasis"
- "Schwann cells"
- "neural signature"
###Verify###
- "oral carcinomas" and "melanoma" suggest potential matches with 'Head Neck' and 'Skin' respectively.
- "tumours" and "metastasis" indicate a focus on cancerous tissues, which could relate to 'Tumor'.
- "Schwann cells" and "neural signature" suggest a connection to neural tissues, possibly 'Brain' or 'Spinal cord'.
###Context###
- The abstract mentions "dietary palmitic acid (PA) promotes metastasis in oral carcinomas and melanoma in mice." This provides a clear context for the types of tumors being studied.
- "genes with this prometastatic memory predominantly relate to a neural signature that stimulates intratumoural Schwann cells and innervation." This indicates a significant neural component, linking to neural tissues.
###Conclusion###
Given the context and specific mentions:
- 'Head Neck' is relevant due to "oral carcinomas."
- 'Skin' is relevant due to "melanoma."
- 'Tumor' is relevant as the study focuses on metastasis and tumour cells.
- 'Brain' or 'Spinal cord' could be considered due to the neural signature and Schwann cells, but these are less directly mentioned compared to the others.
###Result###
['Head Neck', 'Skin', 'Tumor']
