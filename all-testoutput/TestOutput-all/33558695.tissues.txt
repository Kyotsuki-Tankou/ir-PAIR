###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex" is prominently mentioned. This directly suggests that 'Cortex' is a relevant tissue.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We used the 10x Genomics Visium platform to define the spatial topography of gene expression in the six-layered human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." This clearly indicates that the study is focused on a specific region of the brain, specifically the cortex, reinforcing that 'Cortex' is a proper result.
###Context###
Given the detailed focus on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the mention of "cortical laminae," there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Cortex' as our final result.
###Result###
['Cortex']
