###Keywords###
From the abstract, the keywords "lacrimal gland" and "organoids" stand out. These suggest potential matches like 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal gland' and 'Organoids'.
###Verify###
- "lacrimal gland" is directly mentioned multiple times, indicating a strong focus on this organ part.
- "organoids" are also mentioned, but the context is specific to lacrimal gland organoids, not a general term like 'Organoids' in the schema.
###Context###
- The abstract discusses "mouse and human lacrimal gland" and "CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing" in the context of lacrimal gland cells.
- It also mentions "single-cell atlas of human lacrimal gland tissue and organoids," further emphasizing the specific focus on the lacrimal gland.
###Conclusion###
Given the specific and repeated mention of "lacrimal gland," 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal gland' is a relevant match, even though the study is not specifically about carcinoma. The context strongly supports the lacrimal gland as the primary focus.
###Result###
['Adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal gland']
