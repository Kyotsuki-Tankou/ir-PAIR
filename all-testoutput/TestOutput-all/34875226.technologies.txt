### Keywords ###
From the abstract and keywords, the term "Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH)" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'EASI-FISH' is a technology used in the study.
### Verify ###
- The abstract states: "We developed Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to survey gene expression in brain tissue," which directly verifies the presence of 'EASI-FISH'.
- Additionally, the abstract mentions "iterative reanalysis of scRNA-seq datasets," indicating the use of 'scRNA-seq' as another technology.
### Context ###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific technologies used in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'EASI-FISH' and 'scRNA-seq' as our final results based on the explicit mentions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['EASI-FISH', 'scRNA-seq']
