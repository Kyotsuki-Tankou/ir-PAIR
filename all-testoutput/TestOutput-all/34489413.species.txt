### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse heart" and "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes" indicate the species 'Mus musculus' and 'Homo sapiens'.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
1. "adult mouse heart from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury" which confirms the use of 'Mus musculus'.
2. "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes" which confirms the use of 'Homo sapiens'.
### Conclusion ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both consistently point to 'Mus musculus' and 'Homo sapiens', we can confidently conclude that these are the correct species.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus', 'Homo sapiens']
