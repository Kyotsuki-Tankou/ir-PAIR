### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, we have terms like "renal cell cancer," "B cell maturation," "B cell repertoire," "Visium," "anti-tumor IgG," "fibroblasts," "plasma cells," "response to immune check point inhibition," "spatial transcriptomics," and "tertiary lymphoid structures." These terms suggest a focus on renal cell carcinoma and immune responses, but they do not directly indicate a specific species.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and discusses B cell responses within TLS in this context. RCC is a type of cancer that primarily affects humans. Additionally, the mention of "RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors" strongly suggests that the study is focused on humans.
### Context ###
Given the Abstract's clear focus on "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and the involvement of human patients in the treatment context, it is reasonable to infer that the study's primary species of interest is humans. The Keywords, while detailed about cell types and analysis methods, do not explicitly list "Homo sapiens," but the context from the Abstract provides the necessary linkage.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context provided by the Abstract, we can conclude that the primary species relevant to this study is Homo sapiens, despite the absence of direct mention in the Keywords.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
