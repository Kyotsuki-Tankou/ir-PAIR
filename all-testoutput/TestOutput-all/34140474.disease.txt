### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the primary focus is on understanding tissue specialization processes in pigs, characterizing various transcript types, and performing comparative analysis across species. There is no direct mention of any specific disease from the provided schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "transcriptomic variability among 47 skeletal muscles, and six adipose depots" and "comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of seven tissues from pigs and nine other vertebrates." These points suggest a broad focus on tissue specialization and evolutionary biology rather than a specific disease.
### Context ###
Given the context of the study, which is centered around the transcriptomic survey of pigs for understanding tissue specialization and evolutionary divergence, it is clear that the study is not focused on any particular disease but rather on the broader biological and evolutionary aspects.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords, verification, and context, it is evident that the study does not specifically address any of the diseases listed in the schema.
### Result ###
null
