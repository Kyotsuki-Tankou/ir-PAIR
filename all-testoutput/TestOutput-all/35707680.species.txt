### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "human T cell repertoire" suggests that the species involved is 'Homo sapiens'.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "localization of infiltrating T cell clones within the tumor microenvironment"
- "T cell receptor sequences identified by this protocol are readily recapitulated by single-cell sequencing"
These points verify that the study is focused on human T cells, reinforcing that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keyword.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Homo sapiens' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
