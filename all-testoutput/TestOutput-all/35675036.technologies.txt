### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'scRNA' or 'scRNA-seq' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "The tumors of 7 treatment-na√Øve patients with HGSOC at early or late stages and five age-matched nonmalignant ovarian samples were analyzed by deep single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)."
- "A total of 59,324 single cells obtained from HGSOC and nonmalignant ovarian tissues were sequenced by scRNA-seq."
These statements clearly verify the use of 'scRNA-seq' technology in the study.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'scRNA-seq', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA-seq' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['scRNA-seq']
