###Keywords###
From the Abstract, we identify terms like "single-cell RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "spatially separated samples." These terms suggest the use of specific technologies for analyzing cell populations and gene expression in different spatial contexts.
###Verify###
The Abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics." These terms directly correspond to technologies listed in the schema.
###Context###
Given the clear mention of "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract, there is no need for additional context to verify the technologies used.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mentions in the Abstract, we can conclude that the relevant technologies used in this study are "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics."
###Result###
["single-cell RNA sequencing", "Spatial Transcriptomics"]
