### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "skin," "fibrosis," "fibroblasts," "wound healing," "human tissue repair kinetics," "Rainbow transgenic lines," and "multimodal -omics platform." These suggest a focus on tissue repair and fibroblast behavior in the context of skin injury.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions:
- "human tissue repair kinetics"
- "Rainbow transgenic lines"
- "fibroblast fate during the physiologic response to skin injury"
These points indicate that the study involves both human tissue and a model organism, likely a mouse, given the mention of "Rainbow transgenic lines."
### Context ###
The mention of "human tissue repair kinetics" directly implicates 'Homo sapiens' in the study. Additionally, "Rainbow transgenic lines" are typically associated with mouse models, pointing towards 'Mus musculus'.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of human tissue and the use of mouse models, we can conclude that both 'Homo sapiens' and 'Mus musculus' are relevant species in this study.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens', 'Mus musculus']
