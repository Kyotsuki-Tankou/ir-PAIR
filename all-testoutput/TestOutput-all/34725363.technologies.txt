### Keywords ###
From the input, the technologies mentioned are "spatially resolved transcriptomics," "single-cell RNA-seq," and "single-nucleus RNA-seq." These terms suggest potential matches with the schema.
### Verify ###
- "spatially resolved transcriptomics" could be related to several technologies in the schema, but the most direct match is 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- "single-cell RNA-seq" directly matches 'scRNA'.
- "single-nucleus RNA-seq" directly matches 'snRNA'.
### Context ###
The context provided in the abstract clearly specifies the use of these technologies:
- "Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, we identify a distinct 'interface' cell state where the tumor contacts neighboring tissues."
- "Our results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved transcriptomics in uncovering mechanisms that allow tumors to adapt to new environments."
This context confirms that the technologies mentioned are indeed being used in the study as described.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the verification and context, the technologies used in the study are 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA', and 'snRNA'.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA', 'snRNA']
