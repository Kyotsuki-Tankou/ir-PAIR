### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "mouse brain," "kidney," and "ductal carcinoma in situ tissues" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Brain,' 'Kidney,' and 'Ductal carcinoma in situ' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
1. **Mouse Brain**: The abstract mentions "existing mouse brain datasets" and "detect topological patterns of different cell types and cell states in mouse brain," which verifies that 'Brain' is a relevant result.
2. **Kidney**: The abstract also mentions "existing kidney datasets" and the application of CellTrek to these datasets, confirming that 'Kidney' is a relevant result.
3. **Ductal Carcinoma in Situ**: The abstract discusses performing experiments on "two ductal carcinoma in situ tissues" and identifying "tumor subclones that were restricted to different ducts," which verifies that 'Ductal carcinoma in situ' is a relevant result.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keywords.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain,' 'Kidney,' and 'Ductal carcinoma in situ' as our final results based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the keywords and the abstract.
### Result ###
['Brain', 'Kidney', 'Ductal carcinoma in situ']
