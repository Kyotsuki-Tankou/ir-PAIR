### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "adult mouse brain," "isocortex," "hippocampus," and "striatum" are mentioned. These terms suggest that specific brain regions are being studied. Relevant organ parts from the schema could include "Brain," "Striatum," "Hippocampus," and "Coronal brain section."
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "adult mouse brain"
- "new area- and layer-specific subregions, for example in isocortex and hippocampus"
- "new subdivisions of striatum"
These statements directly verify the presence of "Brain," "Striatum," "Hippocampus," and suggest "Coronal brain section" as these are common sections used in brain studies.
### Context ###
Given the direct mention of specific brain regions and the context of creating a molecular atlas of the brain, there is no need for additional context to verify the results.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we can confirm "Brain," "Striatum," "Hippocampus," and "Coronal brain section" as the appropriate results based on the explicit references in the abstract.
### Result ###
["Brain", "Striatum", "Hippocampus", "Coronal brain section"]
