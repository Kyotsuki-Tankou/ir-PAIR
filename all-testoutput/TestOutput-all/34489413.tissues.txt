### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords "heart regeneration," "regenerating cardiomyocytes," "adult mouse heart," and "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes" suggest a focus on heart tissue.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "mammalian neonatal heart regeneration model"
- "regenerating cardiomyocytes"
- "adult mouse heart"
- "human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes"
These references consistently point to the heart as the primary tissue of interest.
### Conclusion ###
Given the consistent mention of the heart in various contexts (neonatal heart regeneration, adult heart protection, and cardiomyocytes), it is clear that the primary tissue being studied is the heart.
### Result ###
['Heart']
