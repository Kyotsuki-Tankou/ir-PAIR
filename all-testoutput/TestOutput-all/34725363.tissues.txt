### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "spatially resolved transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a relevant technology. Additionally, the context involves a "zebrafish model of melanoma" and "human patient samples," suggesting the study focuses on tumor and microenvironment interactions.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Here, we integrate spatially resolved transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and single-nucleus RNA-seq to characterize tumor-microenvironment interactions at the tumor boundary."
- "Our results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved transcriptomics in uncovering mechanisms that allow tumors to adapt to new environments."
These statements clearly verify the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technology in the study.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "tumor," "melanoma," and "human patient samples" suggest that 'Tumor' and possibly 'Skin' (since melanoma is a skin cancer) may be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, we identify a distinct 'interface' cell state where the tumor contacts neighboring tissues."
- "A cilia-enriched interface is conserved in human patient samples, suggesting it is a conserved feature of human melanoma."
These statements verify the involvement of 'Tumor' tissue and suggest 'Skin' due to the context of melanoma.
### Context ###
Melanoma is specifically a type of skin cancer, which adds additional context to include 'Skin' as a relevant tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions and the context of melanoma, we confirm 'Tumor' and 'Skin' as the relevant tissues.
### Result ###
['Tumor', 'Skin']
