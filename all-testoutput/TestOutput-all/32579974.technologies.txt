###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we have "scRNA-seq", "spatial transcriptomics", and "MIBI" which are directly related to the technologies used in the study.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, we see mentions of:
- "single-cell RNA sequencing" which corresponds to 'scRNA'.
- "spatial transcriptomics" which directly matches 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- "multiplexed ion beam imaging" which corresponds to 'MIBI'.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keywords.
###Conclusion###
The technologies mentioned in the Abstract and Keywords clearly match the items in the provided schema.
###Result###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'MIBI']
