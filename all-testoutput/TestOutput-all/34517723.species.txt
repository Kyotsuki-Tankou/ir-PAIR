### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keywords provided are "inflammasomes," "inflammation," "interleukin-1," "monocytes," "smooth muscle myocytes," and "vasculitis." These keywords suggest a focus on immunological and vascular processes but do not directly indicate a specific species.
### Verify ###
- The abstract does not explicitly mention any species.
- The keywords themselves are not inherently tied to a specific species but are relevant to various biological systems.
### Context ###
- Given the keywords, the study likely involves a model organism commonly used in immunological and vascular research.
- "Monocytes" and "smooth muscle myocytes" are cell types found in mammals, suggesting that the study might involve a mammalian species.
### Conclusion ###
Without explicit mention of the species, we need to infer the most likely species based on common usage in related research fields. Among the mammalian options in the schema, "Mus musculus" (mouse) is frequently used in studies involving inflammasomes, inflammation, and vascular research due to its well-characterized genetics and availability of experimental tools.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus']
