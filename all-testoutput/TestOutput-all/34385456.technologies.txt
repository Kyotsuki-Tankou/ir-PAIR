### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "single nuclei RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "single-cell resolution spatial proteomic analysis" suggest the technologies used.
### Verify ###
- "single nuclei RNA sequencing" aligns with 'snRNA'.
- "spatial transcriptomics" directly matches 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- "single-cell resolution spatial proteomic analysis" suggests a combination of single-cell and spatial technologies, but none of the listed technologies perfectly match this description. However, 'CITE-seq' (which combines RNA and protein analysis at the single-cell level) could be a potential match.
### Context ###
The context of the study involves a combination of RNA sequencing at the single-nuclei level and spatial analysis of both transcripts and proteins. This multifaceted approach indicates the use of multiple complementary technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of 'single nuclei RNA sequencing' and 'spatial transcriptomics', we can confidently conclude that 'snRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are used. 'CITE-seq' is a potential additional technology due to the mention of single-cell resolution spatial proteomic analysis, but it is less directly confirmed.
### Result ###
['snRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'CITE-seq']
