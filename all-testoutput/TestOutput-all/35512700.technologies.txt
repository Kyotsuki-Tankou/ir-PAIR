###Keywords###
From the abstract and keywords, "Stereo-seq" is explicitly mentioned as the technology used for the study.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we dissected the spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes of developing Drosophila." This confirms that Stereo-seq is the primary technology employed in the study.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear mention and usage of Stereo-seq in the abstract, it is evident that this technology is central to the study.
###Result###
["Stereo-seq"]
