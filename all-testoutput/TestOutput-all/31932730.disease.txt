### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the focus is on "primary pancreatic tumors," which directly suggests a disease related to the pancreas. The terms "ductal cells," "macrophages," "dendritic cells," and "cancer cells" further imply a focus on cancer, specifically within the pancreas.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly mentions "primary pancreatic tumors," which directly aligns with "Pancreatic cancer" from the schema. The presence of various cell types typically associated with cancer (ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, cancer cells) further supports this.
### Context ###
The context of the study revolves around characterizing the spatial organization of cell populations in primary pancreatic tumors using multimodal intersection analysis. This context strongly supports the focus on pancreatic cancer.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of "primary pancreatic tumors" and the context of cancer-related cell populations, it is clear that "Pancreatic cancer" is the appropriate disease identified in the input.
### Result ###
['Pancreatic cancer']
