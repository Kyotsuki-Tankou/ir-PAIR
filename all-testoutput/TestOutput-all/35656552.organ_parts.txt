###Keywords###
From the provided keywords, the terms "brain region delineation and identification" and "postnatal mouse brain development" suggest a focus on brain regions. The specific brain regions are not mentioned, but "brain" is a central theme.
###Verify###
- The keywords do not directly mention any specific brain regions or organ parts from the schema. However, "brain" is a broad term that could encompass various regions such as 'Cortex', 'Olfactory bulb', 'Striatum', 'Hippocampus', etc.
###Context###
- Given the focus on "brain region delineation and identification" and "postnatal mouse brain development," it is reasonable to infer that the study involves multiple brain regions. However, without specific mentions, we cannot pinpoint exact regions.
###Conclusion###
- The keywords suggest a study focused on the brain, but they do not provide enough detail to identify specific brain regions or organ parts from the schema. Therefore, we cannot conclusively match any specific items from the schema.
###Result###
null
