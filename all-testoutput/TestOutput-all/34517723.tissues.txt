###Keywords###
From the abstract, the keywords are "inflammasomes," "inflammation," "interleukin-1," "monocytes," "smooth muscle myocytes," and "vasculitis." These keywords suggest a focus on immune responses and vascular tissues.
###Verify###
We need to verify if any of these keywords directly correspond to the tissues listed in the schema. 
- "smooth muscle myocytes" could relate to "Muscle."
- "vasculitis" could imply involvement of "Blood vessel."
###Context###
The context involves inflammation and immune responses, particularly in vascular and muscle tissues. While "Muscle" and "Blood vessel" are potential matches, the other keywords do not directly correspond to specific tissues in the schema.
###Conclusion###
Based on the context and the keywords, the most relevant tissues from the schema are "Muscle" and "Blood vessel," as these are directly related to "smooth muscle myocytes" and "vasculitis."
###Result###
['Muscle', 'Blood vessel']
