### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "mouse tumor models" and "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)" suggest that the study involves mouse tissues and specifically tumor-related tissues.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "mouse tumor models" and "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells," which directly indicate the use of mouse tissues. Additionally, the context of tumor studies often involves specific tumor types or related tissues.
### Context ###
The context of the study is focused on understanding the spatial distribution of cells within tumor models, specifically in mice. This further supports the involvement of mouse-related tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear references to "mouse tumor models" and the context of the study, we can conclude that the relevant organ parts are related to mouse tumors.
