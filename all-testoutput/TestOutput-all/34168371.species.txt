### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "human leprosy granulomas" suggests that the study is focused on humans. This indicates that 'Homo sapiens' may be a relevant result.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "we investigated the single-cell phenotypes associated with antimicrobial responses in human leprosy granulomas"
This directly verifies the presence of 'Homo sapiens' in the context of the study.
### Context ###
Given the direct mention of "human" in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the appropriate result based on the explicit references in the abstract.
