### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "aortic microenvironment," "hematopoietic stem cells," and "embryos" are prominent. These suggest potential matches like 'Embryo,' 'Dorsal aorta,' and 'Bone marrow.'
### Verify ###
- "human embryos" and "zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos" clearly indicate the involvement of 'Embryo.'
- "aortic microenvironment" suggests a focus on the 'Dorsal aorta.'
- "hematopoietic stem cells" are typically associated with 'Bone marrow,' although the context is more about their generation site.
### Context ###
- The abstract mentions "genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing on zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos," which emphasizes the role of 'Embryo.'
- "The resulting anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral transcriptional maps provided a powerful resource for exploring genes and regulatory pathways active in the aortic microenvironment." This further supports the importance of 'Dorsal aorta.'
- "By performing interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses and functional assays, we explored the complexity of the aortic microenvironment landscape and the fine-tuning of various factors interacting to control hematopoietic stem cell generation." This indicates a focus on the microenvironment where hematopoietic stem cells are generated, which is closely related to 'Bone marrow.'
### Conclusion ###
Given the context and specific mentions:
- 'Embryo' is directly mentioned and clearly relevant.
- 'Dorsal aorta' is specifically mentioned in the context of the aortic microenvironment.
- 'Bone marrow' is implied due to the focus on hematopoietic stem cells, though not directly mentioned.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Dorsal aorta', 'Bone marrow']
