###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "hippocampus" and "olfactory bulbs" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Brain' may be a proper result since both the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs are parts of the brain.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "our goal was to simultaneously uncover novel and known molecular targets in the structured layers of the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs"
- "we identify Bok, implicated in mitochondrial physiology and cell death, as a spatially downregulated gene in the hippocampus of mouse and human AD brains"
These statements clearly verify the focus on brain tissues, specifically the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs.
###Context###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the focus on brain tissues, there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
###Result###
['Brain']
