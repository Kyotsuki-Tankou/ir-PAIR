###Keywords###
From the abstract, keywords such as "mouse digit tip blastemas," "single-cell RNA sequencing," and "regeneration" are prominent. The term "mouse" directly indicates a potential match to a species in the schema.
###Verify###
The phrase "over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas" clearly verifies that the species being studied is "Mus musculus," which is the scientific name for the mouse.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Mus musculus' as the final result based on the clear and consistent references to mouse in the input.
