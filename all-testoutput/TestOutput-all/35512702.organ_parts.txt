### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "Arabidopsis leaves" is prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Leaf' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "Here, we present scStereo-seq (single-cell spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) that enabled us to show the bona fide single-cell spatial transcriptome profiles of Arabidopsis leaves." This directly references the study being conducted on leaves, specifically of Arabidopsis. This further verifies that 'Leaf' is indeed a relevant and proper result.
### Context ###
Given the direct and clear mention of "Arabidopsis leaves" in both the abstract and the keywords, there is no need for additional context to verify the keyword.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Leaf' as our final result based on the clear and consistent references in the abstract and keywords.
### Result ###
['Leaf']
