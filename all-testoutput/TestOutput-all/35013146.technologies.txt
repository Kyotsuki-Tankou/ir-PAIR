### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "single-cell RNA-sequencing" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'scRNA' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "To characterize the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on prostate biopsies, prostatectomy specimens, and patient-derived organoids from localized prostate cancer patients."
This statement clearly verifies the use of 'single-cell RNA-sequencing' technology in the study.
### Context ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both strongly indicate the use of 'single-cell RNA-sequencing', there is no need for additional context to confirm the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' as the final result based on the explicit mentions and detailed descriptions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['scRNA']
