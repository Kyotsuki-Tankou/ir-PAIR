### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "scRNA-seq" directly indicates the technology 'scRNA'.
From the Abstract, "Spatial transcriptomics" indicates the technology 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "We employed scRNA sequencing" which confirms the use of 'scRNA'.
It also mentions "Spatial transcriptomics further revealed" which confirms the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keywords.
### Conclusion ###
Since both keywords and the abstract consistently point to 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics', we can confidently conclude that these are the correct technologies used.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
