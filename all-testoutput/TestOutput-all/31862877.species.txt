###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "population-based cohort" and "heart transplantation" suggests human subjects are involved. This points towards 'Homo sapiens' as a potential species.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Here we report application of aptamer-based proteomics to identify proteins associated with prospective HF incidence in a population-based cohort..."
- "By leveraging coronary sinus samples and transcriptomic tools, we describe likely cardiac and specific cellular origins for several of the proteins..."
These statements imply human subjects are used in the study, as population-based cohorts and heart transplantation are typically associated with human research.
###Context###
The mention of "population-based cohort" and "heart transplantation" are strong indicators of human involvement. Additionally, the use of coronary sinus samples, which are specific to humans, further supports this.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear indicators of human subjects in the study, we can confidently conclude that 'Homo sapiens' is the appropriate species to be extracted according to the schema.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
