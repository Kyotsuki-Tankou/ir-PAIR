###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we can infer terms related to "synovial biopsies," "rheumatoid arthritis," "spondyloarthritis," "Spatial Transcriptomics," "immune cell type identification," and "inflammation." These terms suggest a focus on synovial tissue and immune responses within that tissue.
###Verify###
The Abstract mentions "synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients" and "studied with ST," which strongly indicates that the study is focused on synovial tissue. The context of the study revolves around analyzing this specific tissue type in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases.
###Context###
Given the Abstract's clear focus on "synovial biopsies" and the analysis of gene expression within these biopsies, it is reasonable to infer that the study's primary tissue of interest is the synovial tissue. The Keywords and the Abstract both provide consistent information pointing to this tissue type.
###Conclusion###
Based on the context provided by the Abstract and the Keywords, we can conclude that the primary tissue relevant to this study is the synovial tissue.
###Result###
['Synovial']
