### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse tumor models" and "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Tumor' and possibly 'Muscle' (due to the mention of MSCs) might be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
- The abstract states: "we used XYZeq to profile mouse tumor models" and "tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)," which directly verifies the presence of 'Tumor'.
- There is no direct mention of 'Muscle' in the context of the tissue being studied; the reference to MSCs does not specifically indicate muscle tissue.
### Context ###
- The focus of the study is on tumor models and the spatial distribution of cells within these tumors, particularly MSCs. This context supports the inclusion of 'Tumor' but not 'Muscle'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Tumor' as the correct tissue based on the explicit mentions in the abstract, while 'Muscle' is not directly supported by the context.
### Result ###
['Tumor']
