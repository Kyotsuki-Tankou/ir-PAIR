### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "human distal airways," "terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs)," and "lung development" are mentioned. This suggests that "Upper pulmonary branches" may be a relevant result as it pertains to the respiratory system.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "human distal airways, including the terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs)"
This directly verifies the presence of "Upper pulmonary branches" in the context of the study, as TRBs are part of the upper pulmonary system.
### Context ###
Given the direct mention of the distal airways and TRBs in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm "Upper pulmonary branches" as the appropriate result based on the explicit references in the abstract.
### Result ###
["Upper pulmonary branches"]
