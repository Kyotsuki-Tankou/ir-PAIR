###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "leprosy granulomas," "biopsy specimens," "macrophages," "lymphocytes," "keratinocytes," and "fibroblasts" are mentioned. These terms suggest involvement of tissues such as 'Skin' and potentially 'Lymph'.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "human leprosy granulomas by applying single-cell and spatial sequencing to leprosy biopsy specimens." Granulomas in leprosy are typically found in the skin.
- It also mentions "macrophages, T cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts," which are cell types commonly found in the skin.
###Context###
- The context of the study involves leprosy, which predominantly affects the skin. The mention of "biopsy specimens" further supports the involvement of 'Skin' as the primary tissue of interest.
- No other tissues from the schema are explicitly mentioned or implied in the context of the study.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mention of leprosy granulomas and the context of skin biopsy specimens, we can confidently conclude that 'Skin' is the relevant tissue.
###Result###
['Skin']
