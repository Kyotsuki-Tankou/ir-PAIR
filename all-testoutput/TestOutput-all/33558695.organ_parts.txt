###Verify###
- "human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex" confirms 'Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex'.
- The context of studying gene expression in the human brain further supports 'Human cortex'.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex' and 'Human cortex' as the final results based on the clear and consistent references to these specific brain regions in the input.
###Result###
['Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex', 'Human cortex']
