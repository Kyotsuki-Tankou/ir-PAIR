### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, terms like "human organs," "human cell landscape (HCL)," and "major human organs" suggest a broad focus on various human organ parts. Specific organ parts are not explicitly mentioned, but the context implies a comprehensive analysis across multiple organs.
### Verify ###
The Abstract states, "we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs," which indicates a wide-ranging study encompassing multiple organ parts. However, no specific organ parts are directly mentioned.
### Context ###
Given the comprehensive nature of the study described in the Abstract, it is clear that the research spans multiple organ parts rather than focusing on a single specific part. The lack of specific mentions in the Abstract means we cannot pinpoint exact organ parts from the provided schema.
### Conclusion ###
Since the Abstract does not specify particular organ parts but rather indicates a broad analysis of major human organs, we cannot definitively extract specific items from the schema.
### Result ###
null
