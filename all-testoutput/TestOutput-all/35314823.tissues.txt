### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the primary focus is on the "olfactory system," "olfactory sensory neurons," and the "olfactory bulb (OB)." This suggests a strong emphasis on neural and sensory tissues related to smell.
### Verify ###
The Abstract specifically mentions "the mouse OB" (olfactory bulb) and the projection of axons to form glomeruli within the OB. This directly points to the "Olfactory bulb" as a key tissue being studied.
### Context ###
To ensure accuracy, we consider the context:
- "The stereotyped positioning of glomeruli in the OB suggests an importance for this organization in odor perception."
- "Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and machine learning, we have generated a map of most glomerular positions in the mouse OB."
These details reinforce that the study's primary focus is on the olfactory bulb, particularly in mice.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear and consistent references to the olfactory bulb in both the Abstract and the context, we can confidently conclude that "Olfactory bulb" is the relevant tissue.
### Result ###
['Olfactory bulb']
