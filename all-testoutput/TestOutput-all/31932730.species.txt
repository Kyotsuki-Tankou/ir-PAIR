### Keywords ###
From the input, the keyword that stands out is "primary pancreatic tumors." This suggests that 'Homo sapiens' might be the species being studied, as pancreatic tumors are typically associated with humans.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "primary pancreatic tumors"
- "subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells"
These terms are commonly associated with human biology, which further verifies that 'Homo sapiens' is likely the species being studied.
### Context ###
The abstract focuses on the spatial organization of cell populations in primary pancreatic tumors, which are a human-specific condition. There is no mention of any other species, reinforcing the likelihood that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of "primary pancreatic tumors" and the context of human-specific cell types, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
