### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, we do not see any direct mention of specific technologies listed in the schema. The terms "Hemopexin," "Intracerebral hemorrhage," and "Protein therapeutics" are mentioned, but they do not correspond to any of the technologies in the schema.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, the following phrases are relevant:
- "we elucidated the two-dimensional spatial transcriptome by sequencing 21760 tissue-covered features"
- "performing bidimensional differential gene expression analysis"
These phrases suggest the use of a spatial transcriptomics technology, but they do not explicitly name any of the technologies listed in the schema.
### Context ###
Given that the abstract mentions "two-dimensional spatial transcriptome" and "bidimensional differential gene expression analysis," we need to consider technologies that are capable of such detailed spatial transcriptomic analysis. The schema includes several technologies that could potentially fit this description, such as 'Spatial Transcriptomics,' 'Slide-seqV2,' 'STARmap,' etc.
### Conclusion ###
While the abstract strongly suggests the use of a spatial transcriptomics technology, it does not provide enough specific information to conclusively identify which one was used. The lack of explicit mention of any specific technology from the schema means we cannot definitively assign any of the listed technologies based on the given information.
### Result ###
null
