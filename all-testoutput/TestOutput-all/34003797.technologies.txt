### Keywords ###
From the Keywords "Expression profiling; Mouse models; Nephrology," we can infer the use of sequencing technologies. The abstract mentions "spatial transcriptomics" and "single-nuclear sequencing," which are specific technologies.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, the phrases "spatial transcriptomics," "single-nuclear sequencing," and "single-cell sequencing" are directly mentioned. These terms correspond to specific technologies listed in the schema.
### Context ###
The abstract details the integration of spatial transcriptomics with single-nuclear sequencing to map cell types and study the effects of acute kidney injury. This context confirms the use of these technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the direct mentions and the context of the study, we can conclude that "Spatial Transcriptomics," "scRNA," and potentially "RNA-seq" (though not explicitly mentioned, it is often associated with single-cell studies) are the relevant technologies used.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA', 'RNA-seq']
