### Keywords ###
From the Keywords "digit tip regeneration; fibroblast heterogeneity; mest; single-cell RNA-seq," there is no direct mention of a specific disease. However, the context of "digit tip regeneration" suggests a focus on a regenerative process rather than a specific disease.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, the phrases "Innate regeneration following digit tip amputation" and "digit tip regeneration is mediated by the blastema" indicate a focus on the regenerative process in mammals, specifically in mouse digit tips. There is no direct mention of any disease from the schema.
### Context ###
- The study involves "single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas and unamputated control digit tips," which emphasizes the regenerative aspect rather than a disease context.
- The mention of "vascular, monocytic, and fibroblastic lineages over regeneration" further supports the focus on regeneration rather than a specific disease.
### Conclusion ###
Given the context and the specific focus on "digit tip regeneration," there is no direct match to any disease listed in the schema. The study is more about the regenerative process rather than a disease condition.
### Result ###
null
