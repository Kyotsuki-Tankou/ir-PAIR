### Keywords ###
From "single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract, it indicates that 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
From "Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and machine learning, we have generated a map of most glomerular positions in the mouse OB" in the Abstract, we can further verify that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are indeed the technologies used.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
