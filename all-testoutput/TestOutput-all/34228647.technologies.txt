###Keywords###
From the Keywords "Brain cancer," "Endothelial cells," and "Vascular Biology," it suggests that the study involves molecular analysis techniques related to RNA sequencing. The mention of "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" directly indicates the use of 'scRNA' technology.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, the phrase "through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of freshly isolated ECs from human glioblastoma and paired tumor peripheral tissues" strongly confirms the use of 'scRNA' technology.
###Context###
Upon reviewing the context, there are no additional clues that suggest the use of any other technology. The entire abstract centers around the application of single-cell RNA sequencing to study endothelial cells in glioblastoma.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' as our final result.
###Result###
['scRNA']
