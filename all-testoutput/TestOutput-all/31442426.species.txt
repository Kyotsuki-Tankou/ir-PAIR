### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "APEX-seq" is prominently mentioned, but it does not directly indicate the species used in the study. However, the context suggests a focus on cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, particularly those relevant to human biology.
### Verify ###
The abstract does not explicitly mention the species. However, the techniques and biological processes described (e.g., stress granules, translation initiation complexes) are highly relevant to human cellular biology.
### Context ###
Given the absence of a direct mention of the species, we need to infer from the context. The use of APEX-seq and APEX-mass spectrometry, which are advanced techniques commonly used in human cell research, suggests that the study is likely conducted in a model organism relevant to human biology.
### Conclusion ###
Considering the context and the common application of these techniques in human research, it is reasonable to infer that 'Homo sapiens' is the most likely species used in the study.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
