###Keywords###
From the "Abstract" and "Keywords," the focus is on "cerebellar neurogenesis," "cerebellar granule neurons (GNs)," "granule neuron progenitors (GNPs)," and "medulloblastoma." This suggests that 'Cerebella' and 'Brain' are relevant tissues.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, it is mentioned:
- "Cerebellar neurogenesis involves the generation of large numbers of cerebellar granule neurons (GNs) throughout development of the cerebellum."
- "Here, we provide a comparative single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis to better understand the similarities and differences between developing granule and medulloblastoma cells."
These statements confirm that the study is heavily focused on the cerebellum, which is a part of the brain.
###Context###
To further verify:
- The study involves "24,919 murine cerebellar cells" and "18,372 cells from Patched+/-mutant mice," indicating a specific focus on the cerebellum.
- The mention of "SHH medulloblastoma" aligns with the cerebellum as medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumor that originates in the cerebellum.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit focus on the cerebellum and its relation to the brain, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Cerebella' and 'Brain' are the correct tissues relevant to this study.
###Result###
['Cerebella', 'Brain']
