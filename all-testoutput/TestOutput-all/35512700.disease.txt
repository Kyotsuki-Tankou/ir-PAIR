###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "Drosophila development" and "Stereo-seq" are prominently mentioned. The study focuses on the spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes in developing Drosophila.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Here, utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we dissected the spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes of developing Drosophila with high resolution and sensitivity."
- "We demonstrated that Stereo-seq data can be used for the 3D reconstruction of the spatial transcriptomes of Drosophila embryos and larvae."
These statements clearly indicate that the study is centered around "Drosophila development" and uses "Stereo-seq" technology.
###Context###
The context of the study is explicitly about the development of Drosophila and the use of Stereo-seq to understand spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes. There is no ambiguity in the context that would require further clarification.
###Conclusion###
Based on the clear and direct mention of "Drosophila development" and the use of "Stereo-seq" technology, we can confidently conclude that "Drosophila development" is the relevant disease or condition to be extracted according to the schema.
###Result###
["Drosophila development"]
