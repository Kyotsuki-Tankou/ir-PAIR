###Keywords###
From the abstract, there is no direct mention of a specific species. However, the context of "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients" and "synovial biopsies from affected joints" suggests that 'Homo sapiens' may be the proper result.
###Verify###
The phrases "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients" and "synovial biopsies from affected joints" in the abstract directly imply that the study is focused on humans, which supports 'Homo sapiens' as the correct species.
###Conclusion###
Since the keywords and the context in the abstract both point to 'Homo sapiens', we can confidently conclude that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species involved in this study.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
