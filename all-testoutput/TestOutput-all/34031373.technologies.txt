### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "Single-cell RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "ClumpSeq" are prominent, suggesting that 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and 'ClumpSeq' may be relevant technologies.
### Verify ###
1. **Single-cell RNA sequencing**: The abstract mentions "Single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial information on landmark genes," which directly aligns with the 'scRNA' technology.
2. **Spatial Transcriptomics**: The mention of "spatially-resolved tissue cell atlases" and "spatial transcriptomics bulk measurements" supports the inclusion of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
3. **ClumpSeq**: The abstract introduces "ClumpSeq, an approach for sequencing small clumps of attached cells," which directly corresponds to the 'ClumpSeq' technology.
### Context ###
The abstract focuses on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial information and introduces a novel method, ClumpSeq, for sequencing small clumps of cells. This context supports the use of 'scRNA' for single-cell analysis, 'Spatial Transcriptomics' for spatial resolution, and 'ClumpSeq' for the specific method described.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear mentions and the context provided, we can confidently conclude that the relevant technologies are 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and 'ClumpSeq'.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'ClumpSeq']
