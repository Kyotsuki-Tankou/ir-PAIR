### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "mouse embryos" directly indicates the species involved. Other terms like "microvasculature in a brain" and "pigmented epithelium in an eye field" provide context but do not change the primary species focus.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly mentions "mouse embryos," which directly corresponds to the species "Mus musculus" in the schema.
### Context ###
The study involves the application of DBiT-seq to mouse embryos, focusing on early organogenesis and fine features within these embryos. The context is clearly centered around the mouse model.
### Conclusion ###
The direct mention of "mouse embryos" leaves no ambiguity about the species used in the study.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus']
