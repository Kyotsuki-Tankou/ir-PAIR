### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "single-cell epigenomic assays", "spatial orientation", "sciMAP-ATAC", "cortical lamination", "adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex", "human primary visual cortex", and "cerebral ischemic infarction". These keywords suggest a focus on brain tissues, specifically the cortex, in both mouse and human models.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex"
- "human primary visual cortex"
- "cerebral ischemic infarction in the mouse brain"
These points verify that the study involves brain tissues, particularly the cortex, in both mouse and human subjects.
### Context ###
While the abstract does not explicitly use the term "Cortex" for every instance, the detailed mention of "somatosensory cortex" and "visual cortex" clearly indicates that the cortex is the primary tissue of interest. Additionally, the context of "cerebral ischemic infarction" further supports the focus on brain tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit and repeated mentions of different cortical regions in both mouse and human brains, "Cortex" is the most appropriate tissue to be extracted from the schema.
### Result ###
['Cortex']
