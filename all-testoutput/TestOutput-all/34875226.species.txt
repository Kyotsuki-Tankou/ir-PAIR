###Keywords###
From the Keywords "brain," "lateral hypothalamus," and the context of the study focusing on brain tissue, it suggests that 'Homo sapiens' or 'Mus musculus' might be relevant species, as these are commonly used in brain research.
###Verify###
In the Abstract, there is no direct mention of the species. However, the use of terms like "brain tissue" and "lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)" typically aligns with studies conducted in model organisms such as mice or humans.
###Context###
Upon reviewing the context, the abstract does not specify the species directly. However, the complexity and depth of the study, including the use of thick brain sections and the focus on anatomical organization, are characteristics often associated with research in mammalian models, particularly mice ('Mus musculus').
###Conclusion###
Given the common use of mice in such detailed brain studies and the lack of specific mention of any other species, 'Mus musculus' is a reasonable inference.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
