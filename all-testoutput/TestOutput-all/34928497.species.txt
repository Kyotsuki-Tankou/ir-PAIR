###Keywords###
From the input, the term "benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)" and "prostates from 5ARI-treated men" indicate that 'Homo sapiens' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The Abstract mentions "aging men," "prostates from 5ARI-treated men," and "lower urinary tract symptoms," which are all specific to human conditions. This further verifies that 'Homo sapiens' is indeed the relevant species.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the final result based on the clear and consistent references to human-specific conditions and tissues in the input.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
