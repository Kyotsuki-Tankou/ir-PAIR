### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" is prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Renal pelvis' or 'Kidney organoid' might be relevant organ parts.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically focuses on "B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)" and mentions "RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors," which further verifies that 'Renal pelvis' or 'Kidney organoid' could be relevant.
### Context ###
The context of the study is centered around renal cell carcinoma and the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. The term "renal cell carcinoma" directly points to the kidney, but the specific parts mentioned in the schema are 'Renal pelvis' and 'Kidney organoid'. Given the focus on the tumor and its microenvironment, 'Renal pelvis' is more contextually appropriate as it is a specific part of the kidney where tumors can occur.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear and consistent focus on renal cell carcinoma and the specific mention of RCC, 'Renal pelvis' is the most appropriate match from the schema.
### Result ###
['Renal pelvis']
