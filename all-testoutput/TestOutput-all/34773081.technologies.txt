### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the following technologies are mentioned or implied:
- "single-cell gene expression analyses"
- "single-cell transcriptomic dataset"
- "scRNAseq datasets"
- "single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets"
- "spatial RNA sequencing"
### Verify ###
- "single-cell transcriptomic dataset" and "scRNAseq datasets" directly correspond to "scRNA" and "RNA-seq."
- "single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets" corresponds to "snRNA."
- "spatial RNA sequencing" corresponds to "Spatial Transcriptomics."
### Context ###
- The abstract emphasizes the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data to overcome limitations in studying muscle repair.
- The use of "scRNAseq" and "snRNAseq" datasets indicates a focus on single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing technologies.
- The mention of "spatial RNA sequencing" underscores the importance of spatial context in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mentions and the context of the study, the relevant technologies from the schema are "scRNA," "snRNA," "RNA-seq," and "Spatial Transcriptomics."
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'snRNA', 'RNA-seq', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
