### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses" suggest the potential use of several technologies such as 'RNA-seq', 'scRNA', and possibly 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Verify ###
- The phrase "Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses" directly mentions 'RNA-seq' and 'single-cell RNA-seq' (which can be inferred as 'scRNA').
- The term "positional RNA-sequencing" could imply a spatial component, suggesting 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Context ###
- The study involves analyzing the effects of dietary palmitic acid on metastasis in mice, which requires detailed genomic and transcriptomic analyses.
- The mention of "single-cell" indicates the need for high-resolution techniques like 'scRNA'.
- The term "positional" suggests a spatial aspect, which is characteristic of 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Conclusion ###
Given the explicit mention of "bulk," "single-cell," and "positional" RNA-sequencing, we can confidently conclude that the technologies used include 'RNA-seq', 'scRNA', and 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
### Result ###
['RNA-seq', 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
