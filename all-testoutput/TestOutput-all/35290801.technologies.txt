###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "spatial transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "Moreover, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased analysis of CRISPR-edited tumors." This directly verifies the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics' in the study.
###Context###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the use of spatial transcriptomics in the study.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final result based on the explicit mention in the abstract.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
