###Keywords###
From the abstract, the phrases "genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing" and "interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses" suggest that 'RNA-seq' and 'Tomo-seq' might be relevant technologies.
###Verify###
1. "genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing" directly implies the use of 'Tomo-seq'.
2. "interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses" suggests the use of 'RNA-seq'.
###Context###
The abstract mentions "genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing on zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos," which confirms the use of 'Tomo-seq'. Additionally, "interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses" supports the use of 'RNA-seq'.
###Conclusion###
Both 'Tomo-seq' and 'RNA-seq' are confirmed as the technologies used in the study based on the context and verification.
###Result###
['Tomo-seq', 'RNA-seq']
