###Keywords###
From the keywords "Single-cell RNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics," we can deduce that these technologies might be proper results based on the provided schema.
###Verify###
The input text mentions:
1. "we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 24,919 murine cerebellar cells"
2. "Further spatial transcriptomics technology enabled visualization of their spatial locations in cerebellum"
These statements directly confirm the use of "Single-cell RNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics" technologies.
###Context###
Given the direct and clear mentions of both "Single-cell RNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics" in both the abstract and the keywords, there is no need for additional context to verify these keywords.
###Conclusion###
Since the keywords and the verification both point to "Single-cell RNA sequencing" and "Spatial transcriptomics," we can conclude that these are the correct results.
###Result###
["Single-cell RNA sequencing", "Spatial transcriptomics"]
