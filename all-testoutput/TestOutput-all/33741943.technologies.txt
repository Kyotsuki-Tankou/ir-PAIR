### Keywords ###
From the phrases "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract, it indicates that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
- From "Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool" in the Abstract, we can verify that 'scRNA' is indeed a proper result.
- From "combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract, we can further verify that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is also a proper result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
