###Keywords###
The Abstract mentions "the kidney and upper urinary tract," "ureteric bud," "nephron formation," "intermediate mesoderm of the embryo," and "renal collecting duct system." These terms suggest a focus on kidney development and associated structures, but do not directly indicate a specific species.
###Verify###
The Abstract does not explicitly mention any species name. However, the context of the study, which involves detailed developmental biology and the use of techniques like single cell RNA-seq, suggests it is likely conducted in a well-characterized model organism.
###Context###
Given the detailed nature of the study and the common use of model organisms in such research, it is reasonable to infer that a common model organism like 'Mus musculus' (mouse) might be used. The absence of any specific species mention in the Abstract necessitates this inference based on typical research practices.
###Conclusion###
Based on the context and the common use of 'Mus musculus' in developmental biology studies, we can infer that the species likely used in this study is 'Mus musculus'.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
