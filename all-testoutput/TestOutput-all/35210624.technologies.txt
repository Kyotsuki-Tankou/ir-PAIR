###Keywords###
From the abstract, keywords like "single-cell transcriptomics," "spatial transcriptomics," and "in vivo barcoding" suggest the use of advanced sequencing and labeling technologies. The mention of "reconstructing thousands of clones" and "high-throughput dense reconstruction" implies sophisticated analytical methods.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically mentions "single-cell and spatial transcriptomics" and "in vivo barcoding," which directly correspond to technologies listed in the schema.
###Conclusion###
The keywords and the verification both clearly indicate the use of "single-cell transcriptomics" and "spatial transcriptomics," which are directly mentioned in the input text.
###Result###
["single-cell transcriptomics", "spatial transcriptomics"]
