###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "intracranial hemorrhage," "heme-exposed brain," and "striatum of C57BL/6J mice" indicate that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions:
- "This study aimed to generate a spatially resolved map of transcriptome-wide gene expression changes in the heme-exposed brain"
- "We stereotactically injected saline, heme, or hemeâ€’hemopexin into the striatum of C57BL/6J mice"
- "Heme exerted a consistent and dose-dependent proinflammatory activity in the brain"
These points further verify that 'Brain' is indeed the tissue studied in the experiment.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Brain' as our final result.
###Result###
['Brain']
