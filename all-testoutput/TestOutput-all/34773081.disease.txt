###Keywords###
From the abstract, terms like "skeletal muscle repair," "myogenic stem and progenitor cells," "single-cell gene expression analyses," "muscle repair," "spatial transcriptomic data," and "myogenesis" are prominent. These suggest a focus on muscle regeneration and repair processes.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions:
- "Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells."
- "We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle..."
- "The resulting dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range of ages, injury, and repair conditions."
- "We built a densely sampled transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to myofiber maturation..."
- "We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle at three time points after injury..."
These statements verify that the study is focused on the processes involved in muscle repair and regeneration.
###Context###
While the abstract does not explicitly mention a specific disease, it heavily emphasizes the mechanisms of muscle repair and regeneration, which aligns with the concept of "Muscle regeneration" and "Tissue repair" from the schema.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear focus on muscle repair and regeneration processes, "Muscle regeneration" and "Tissue repair" are the most appropriate matches from the provided schema.
###Result###
["Muscle regeneration", "Tissue repair"]
