### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" indicate that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
1. **single-cell RNA sequencing**: The abstract mentions "Organoids were assessed by phenotype and single-cell RNA sequencing," which verifies that 'scRNA' is indeed a technology used in the study.
2. **spatial transcriptomics**: The abstract also mentions "Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics," which verifies that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is also a technology used in the study.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the results without ambiguity.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
