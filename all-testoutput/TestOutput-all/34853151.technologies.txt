### Keywords ###
From the abstract, keywords such as "single-cell sequencing technologies," "spatial transcriptomic sequencing platforms," "10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression," "Giotto," and "SPOTlight" are prominent. These terms suggest the use of specific technologies for spatial transcriptomics.
### Verify ###
Upon reviewing the abstract, the following technologies are explicitly mentioned:
- "10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression"
- "Giotto"
- "SPOTlight"
### Context ###
The abstract focuses on the use of spatial transcriptomic technologies to study kidney injury and repair. The mention of "10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression" directly corresponds to a technology in the schema. Additionally, "Giotto" and "SPOTlight" are computational tools used to analyze the data generated by these technologies, but they are not listed in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
The explicit mention of "10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression" directly matches a technology in the provided schema. The other tools mentioned (Giotto and SPOTlight) are not listed in the schema and thus are not included in the result.
### Result ###
["10x Visium"]
