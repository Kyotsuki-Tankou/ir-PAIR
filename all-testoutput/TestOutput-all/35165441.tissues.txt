### Keywords ###
From the "Abstract," the terms "human brain vasculature," "hippocampus and cortex samples," and "Alzheimer's disease" suggest that 'Brain,' 'Cortex,' and potentially 'Alzheimer disease' could be relevant.
### Verify ###
- The abstract mentions "human brain vasculature" and "hippocampus and cortex samples," which directly indicate the involvement of 'Brain' and 'Cortex.'
- The term "Alzheimer's disease" is explicitly mentioned, which corresponds to 'Alzheimer disease' in the schema.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the "human brain vasculature" and specifically mentions "hippocampus and cortex samples," which strongly supports the inclusion of 'Brain' and 'Cortex.'
- The mention of "Alzheimer's disease" and its association with the brain vasculature further reinforces the relevance of 'Alzheimer disease.'
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear and direct mentions of 'Brain,' 'Cortex,' and 'Alzheimer's disease' in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that these terms are appropriate to extract.
### Result ###
['Brain', 'Cortex', 'Alzheimer disease']
