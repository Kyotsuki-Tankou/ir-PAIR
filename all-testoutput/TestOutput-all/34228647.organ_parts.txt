###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "brain," "glioblastoma (GBM)," and "human brain ECs" are mentioned, indicating that 'Brain' and 'Glioblastoma multiforme tissue' may be relevant organ parts.
###Verify###
1. The abstract states, "Tumor vessels in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in humans," which directly verifies the involvement of 'Glioblastoma multiforme tissue'.
2. It also mentions, "through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of freshly isolated ECs from human glioblastoma and paired tumor peripheral tissues," which further confirms the focus on 'Glioblastoma multiforme tissue'.
3. The context of studying the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and brain endothelial cells (ECs) suggests a broader focus on the 'Brain'.
###Context###
The study is specifically focused on the endothelial cells within the context of glioblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor. This dual focus on both the specific tumor type and the broader organ (brain) is evident.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear mentions and the context, we can conclude that both 'Brain' and 'Glioblastoma multiforme tissue' are relevant organ parts involved in the study.
###Result###
['Brain', 'Glioblastoma multiforme tissue']
