### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)" and "ovarian tissues" are mentioned, which suggest that 'Ovarian' may be a relevant result.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically states:
- "The heterogeneity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is not well studied"
- "tumors of 7 treatment-na√Øve patients with HGSOC"
- "nonmalignant ovarian samples"
These statements directly verify the presence of 'Ovarian' tissue in the context of the study.
### Context ###
Given the direct mention of ovarian cancer and ovarian tissues in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Ovarian' as the appropriate result based on the explicit references in the abstract.
### Result ###
["Ovarian"]
