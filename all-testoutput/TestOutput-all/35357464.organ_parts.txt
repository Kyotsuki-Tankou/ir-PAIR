These phrases indicate a focus on various regions and tissues within the uterus, particularly around the embryo implantation site.
### Context ###
Given the specific mention of "embryo implantation site" and related uterine tissues, we need to determine if these terms directly correspond to any items in the provided schema. The schema includes terms like "Embryo implantation site", "Uterus", and "Decidua", which are directly related to the context described in the Abstract.
