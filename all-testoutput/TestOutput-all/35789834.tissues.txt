### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC)" and "prostate tumors" are prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Prostate' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically discusses "prostate tumors from 7 patients" and "the mechanisms governing its [NEPC's] emergence," which further verifies that 'Prostate' is indeed a relevant tissue type in this context.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on prostate cancer, particularly NEPC, and the use of scRNA-seq to analyze prostate tumors, there is no need for additional context to confirm the relevance of 'Prostate'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Prostate' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on prostate cancer throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Prostate']
