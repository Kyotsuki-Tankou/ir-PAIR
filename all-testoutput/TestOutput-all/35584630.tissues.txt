###Keywords###
From the abstract, the primary focus is on "human brain metastases" and "CD8+ T cells" within the brain tumor microenvironment. The relevant tissue from the schema that directly matches this context is 'Brain'.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly mentions "human brain metastases" multiple times, which strongly indicates that 'Brain' is the relevant tissue being studied.
###Context###
The context of the study revolves around the analysis of brain metastases and the behavior of CD8+ T cells within these metastases. There is no mention of other tissues, which reinforces that 'Brain' is the central focus.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear and repeated mention of "brain metastases" and the specific analysis of CD8+ T cells within the brain tumor microenvironment, it is conclusive that 'Brain' is the relevant tissue from the schema.
###Result###
['Brain']
