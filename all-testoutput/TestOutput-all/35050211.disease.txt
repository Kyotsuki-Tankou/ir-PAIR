### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "neonatal heart," "regenerative potential," "fibrotic scar resolution," "new cardiomyocytes," and "heart repair" are prominent. These suggest a focus on "Heart regeneration and repair" and possibly "Neonatal heart regeneration."
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "neonatal mammalian heart exhibits a remarkable regenerative potential"
- "investigate the mechanisms facilitating heart repair after apical resection in neonatal mice"
- "spatial transcriptomics provided near single-cell resolution, revealing distinct domains of atrial and ventricular myocardium"
- "transitions from a proliferative to secretory phenotype as the heart loses regenerative potential"
- "regenerative border zone defined by immature cardiomyocyte markers"
These points directly verify the presence of "Heart regeneration and repair" and "Neonatal heart regeneration."
### Context ###
Given the explicit focus on the regenerative processes and mechanisms in the neonatal heart, there is no need for additional context to verify the results.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm "Heart regeneration and repair" and "Neonatal heart regeneration" as the appropriate results based on the explicit references in the abstract.
### Result ###
["Heart regeneration and repair", "Neonatal heart regeneration"]
