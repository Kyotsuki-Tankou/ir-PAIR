### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse embryo," "epiblast," "germ layers," "gastrulation," and "post-implantation development" are prominently mentioned. These terms suggest that 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' are relevant tissue types.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically discusses "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo" and "the formation of the basic body plan during gastrulation," which verifies that 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' are indeed relevant tissue types in this context.
### Context ###
The detailed focus on the stages of embryonic development, including the transition from naive to primed pluripotent states and the formation of germ layers during gastrulation, provides a clear context that supports the relevance of 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula'.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear and consistent focus on embryonic development and gastrulation, we can confidently conclude that 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' are the relevant tissue types.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Gastrula']
