###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "gastric cancer," "GAN mice," "organoids," "GAN-KP tumors," "liver metastasis," and "stromal cells" are explicitly mentioned, indicating a focus on gastric cancer and its metastatic progression.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "To elucidate the mechanism underlying the oncogene-induced gastric tumor progression, we have developed an organoid-based model of gastric cancer from GAstric Neoplasia (GAN) mice."
- "GAN-KP organoids showed a Wnt-independent phenotype and the ability to proliferate without formation of a Wnt-regulated three-dimensional epithelial architecture."
- "After transplantation in syngeneic mouse stomach, GAN-p53KO cells formed only small tumors, whereas GAN-KP cells gave rise to invasive tumors associated with the development of hypoxia as well as to liver metastasis."
These statements directly verify the focus on "Gastric cancer" and "GAN-KP tumor."
###Context###
The study involves:
- Development of an organoid-based model from GAN mice.
- Genetic manipulation to create different types of organoids (GAN-WT, GAN-p53KO, GAN-KP).
- Analysis of tumor progression and metastasis, particularly focusing on the GAN-KP tumors.
- Spatial transcriptomics analysis to understand the role of hypoxia signaling in metastatic progression.
###Conclusion###
Since the terms "Gastric cancer" and "GAN-KP tumor" are both mentioned in the keywords and clearly verified in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that these are the appropriate organ parts studied.
###Result###
["Gastric cancer", "GAN-KP tumor"]
