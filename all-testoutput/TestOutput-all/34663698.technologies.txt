### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, we see "spatial transcriptomics" which suggests that a technology related to spatial transcriptomics might be used.
### Verify ###
In the Abstract, it is stated that "Comparative spatial transcriptomic analysis of the cranial sutures in vivo confirmed a positive association between sensory axons and proliferative MPCs." This indicates the use of a spatial transcriptomics technology.
### Context ###
The Abstract emphasizes the use of spatial transcriptomics for analyzing cranial sutures and mentions "SpatialTime analysis," which suggests a technology capable of detailed spatial and temporal resolution. The technologies listed in the schema that align with these capabilities include "Spatial Transcriptomics," "Slide-seqV2," and "STARmap."
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context and the nature of the described methodology, it is reasonable to infer that "Spatial Transcriptomics" is the most directly mentioned and fitting technology used, given its explicit mention in both the Keywords and the Abstract.
### Result ###
["Spatial Transcriptomics"]
