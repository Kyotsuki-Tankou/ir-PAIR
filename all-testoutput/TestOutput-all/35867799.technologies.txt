### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the following technologies are mentioned:
- "single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing"
- "ultrahigh-resolution Seq-Scope analyses"
### Verify ###
- "single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing" suggests the use of technologies like 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', or similar.
- "ultrahigh-resolution Seq-Scope analyses" directly mentions 'Seq-Scope'.
### Context ###
The abstract combines multiple technologies to study acne lesions, emphasizing both single-cell and spatial aspects of RNA sequencing, along with Seq-Scope for high-resolution analysis. This context supports the identification of the mentioned technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions and the context provided, the technologies used in the study are 'scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', and 'Seq-Scope'.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics', 'Seq-Scope']
