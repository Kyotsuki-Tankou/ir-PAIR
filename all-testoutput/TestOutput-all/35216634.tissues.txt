### Verify ###
- The abstract mentions "lung fibroblasts," "alveolar epithelial cells," and "endothelial cells," which are all components of the lung tissue.
- The study's focus on "pulmonary fibrosis" further confirms the relevance of the "Lung" tissue.
### Context ###
- The abstract discusses the mechanism of fibroblast activation in pulmonary fibrosis, specifically involving lung cells.
- The use of assays like CCK-8, western blot, and flow cytometry on lung cells supports the context that the study is centered around the lung tissue.
### Conclusion ###
The abstract clearly and consistently focuses on the lung tissue, making "Lung" a definitively relevant term to extract.
### Result ###
['Lung']
