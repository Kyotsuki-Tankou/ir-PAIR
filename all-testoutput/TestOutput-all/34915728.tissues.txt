### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords related to tissues are "left ventricles (LVs)", "LV dilation", "LV dysfunction", and "cardiomyocytes". These terms suggest that 'Heart' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC)", "LV-specific dilation and dysfunction", and "cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (Prdm16cKO) mice". These phrases further verify that the study focuses on the heart, specifically the left ventricle.
### Context ###
The study involves "cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of Prdm16 in mice" and examines the effects on the left ventricle, which is a part of the heart. The terms "LV-specific dilation and dysfunction" and "LVNC" are directly related to the heart tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Given the repeated and specific references to the left ventricle and cardiomyocytes, we can conclude that 'Heart' is the relevant tissue being studied.
### Result ###
['Heart']
