### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keyword "murine cerebellar cells" suggests that the species being studied is likely 'Mus musculus'. Additionally, "Math1-GFP; Dcx-DsRed mice" further supports the use of mice in the study.
### Verify ###
- "single-cell RNA sequencing of 24,919 murine cerebellar cells" directly indicates the use of mice.
- "Patched+/-mutant mice" also confirms the involvement of mice in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of "murine" and specific mouse strains like "Math1-GFP; Dcx-DsRed mice" and "Patched+/-mutant mice," it is evident that the species used in the study is 'Mus musculus'.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus']
