### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, "Cell biology" and "Pathophysiology" suggest a focus on cellular processes and disease mechanisms. "Transcriptomics" indicates the study of RNA expression. The Abstract mentions "mouse and human kidneys," which directly points to 'Kidney' as a relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
The Abstract specifically states, "We applied Slide-seqV2 to mouse and human kidneys, in healthy and distinct disease paradigms." This directly verifies that 'Kidney' is the primary tissue of focus in this study.
### Context ###
Since the Abstract and Keywords both clearly point to 'Kidney' as the primary tissue of interest, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Kidney' as our final result based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the Abstract and Keywords.
### Result ###
['Kidney']
