###Keywords###
The abstract mentions "mouse gastruloids" and "mouse embryos," which are related to development and embryology. However, these terms do not directly match any of the items in the provided schema.
###Verify###
The abstract does not provide a specific mention of any organ parts from the schema, such as "Gastrulation" or "Embryo," which could be potential matches. The focus is on gastruloids and their comparison with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics.
###Context###
Given the context, it seems that the research involves gastruloids, which are aggregates of embryonic stem cells. While gastrulation is a process that occurs during early embryonic development, the abstract does not specify the use of gastrulation as an organ part or a specific structure from the schema.
###Conclusion###
The abstract does not mention any specific organ parts from the schema. Therefore, we cannot extract any items from the schema corresponding to the given input.
###Result###
null
