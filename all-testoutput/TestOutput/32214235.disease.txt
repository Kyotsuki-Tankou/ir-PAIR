### Keywords ###
The abstract mentions "single-cell analysis," "single-cell mRNA sequencing," "cell-type composition of all major human organs," and "human cell landscape (HCL)." These keywords suggest that the study is focused on human organs and cell types, but do not directly indicate any specific diseases or conditions from the schema.
### Verify ###
The abstract provides no direct mention of diseases or conditions from the schema, such as "Prostate Cancer," "Lung cancer," or "Breast cancer." However, it does discuss the use of single-cell analysis and mRNA sequencing to understand cell-type composition across multiple organs, which implies a comprehensive study rather than focusing on a specific disease.
### Context ###
Since the abstract does not mention any specific diseases, we must consider the broader context. The use of "all major human organs" and the construction of a human cell landscape suggests a study that is more about cellular and tissue-level analysis than about disease states.
### Conclusion ###
Given the absence of disease-specific keywords and the comprehensive nature of the study, there is no disease from the schema that can be directly associated with the described research. Therefore, we cannot extract any items from the schema corresponding to the diseases listed.
### Result ###
null
