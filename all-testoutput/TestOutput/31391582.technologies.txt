### Keywords ###
The abstract discusses "spatially resolved transcriptome," "germ layers," and "development from pre- to late-gastrulation stages," which suggests the use of spatial transcriptomics or a similar technique for studying gene expression in specific regions of the embryo.
### Verify ###
The mention of "a genome-wide molecular annotation of lineage segregation and tissue architecture" indicates that the study involves a detailed genomic analysis, which is typically done using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or similar high-throughput sequencing technologies. The term "spatiotemporal transcriptome" also points to the use of spatial transcriptomics, which is a method that combines RNA sequencing with spatial information.
### Context ###
The abstract describes the analysis of gene expression in different regions of the germ layers during gastrulation, which is a critical stage in embryonic development. This suggests that the study likely employs techniques that can analyze gene expression at both the cellular and tissue levels, which are hallmarks of spatial transcriptomics and RNA-seq.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords, the verification, and the context provided in the abstract, it can be concluded that the study employs spatial transcriptomics and RNA-seq technologies to analyze gene expression in the early mouse embryo during gastrulation.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'RNA-seq']
