### Keywords ###
The keywords from the input that correspond to the schema are "single-cell RNA sequencing," "spatial transcriptomics," and "multiplexed ion beam imaging."
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics"
- "multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs"
These statements verify that the technologies 'single-cell RNA sequencing,' 'spatial transcriptomics,' and 'multiplexed ion beam imaging' are indeed used in the study.
### Context ###
The abstract provides a clear context that the study utilizes these technologies to understand the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).
### Conclusion ###
Since the keywords match the technologies mentioned in the abstract, we can conclude that 'single-cell RNA sequencing,' 'spatial transcriptomics,' and 'multiplexed ion beam imaging' are the appropriate results.
### Result ###
['single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatial transcriptomics', 'multiplexed ion beam imaging']
