Let's think step by step.
### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region," "aorta," "endothelin 1," and "hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)." These suggest that 'Aorta' and 'Embryo' might be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region"
- "aorta"
This directly verifies that 'Aorta' is a relevant tissue.
- "embryonic"
This suggests that 'Embryo' is also a relevant tissue, as it is mentioned in the context of the AGM region's development.
### Context ###
The mention of "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros" indicates an early stage of development where the aorta and other tissues are forming. This context further supports the relevance of 'Embryo' as a tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention and context provided, we choose 'Aorta' and 'Embryo' as our final results.
### Result ###
['Aorta', 'Embryo']
