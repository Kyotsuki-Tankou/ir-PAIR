###Keywords###
From the abstract, we can identify several key technologies and concepts such as "APEX-seq," "RNA sequencing," "direct proximity labeling," and "spatial transcriptomics."
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly mentions "APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2." This directly verifies the presence of "APEX-seq" as a technology used in the study.
###Context###
The context of the abstract is focused on the application of APEX-seq for RNA sequencing and the insights gained about transcriptome organization and localization.
###Conclusion###
Based on the clear mention of APEX-seq in the abstract, we can conclude that "APEX-seq" is the relevant technology from the schema.
###Result###
['APEX-seq']
