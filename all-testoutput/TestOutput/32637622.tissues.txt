### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "adult mouse brain," "whole-brain spatial transcriptomics," and "neuroanatomical organization" suggest that 'Brain' is a relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly states:
- "We aimed to generate a systematic classification of the adult mouse brain based purely on the unbiased identification of spatially defining features by employing whole-brain spatial transcriptomics."
This verifies that 'Brain' is the primary focus of the study.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of the adult mouse brain and its systematic classification using whole-brain spatial transcriptomics, we conclude that 'Brain' is the appropriate result.
### Result ###
['Brain']
