###Keywords###
The input abstract mentions "large scale single cell transcriptome analysis," which suggests the use of a technology that involves RNA sequencing at the single-cell level. This points towards 'scRNA' as a potential result from the schema.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly states:
- "by employing large scale single cell transcriptome analysis"
This statement confirms the use of a technology that fits the description of 'scRNA' from the schema.
###Context###
No additional context is necessary as the keywords and verify steps both confirm the use of 'scRNA' technology.
###Conclusion###
Based on the explicit mention and the nature of the analysis described in the abstract, we can conclude that 'scRNA' is the correct result.
###Result###
['scRNA']
