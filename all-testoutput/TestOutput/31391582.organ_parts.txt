###Keywords###
From the keywords "mouse embryo," "development," "gastrulation," "germ layers," and "embryogenesis," we can infer that 'Mouse Embryo' and possibly 'Gastrulation' are relevant to the study described.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly mentions "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," confirming that 'Mouse Embryo' is indeed a proper result. It also discusses "development from pre- to late-gastrulation stages," which indicates that 'Gastrulation' is also a relevant result.
###Context###
No additional context is required, as the abstract provides clear and direct references to both 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Gastrulation'.
###Conclusion###
Based on the information in the abstract, we conclude that 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Gastrulation' are the appropriate results.
###Result###
['Mouse Embryo', 'Gastrulation']
