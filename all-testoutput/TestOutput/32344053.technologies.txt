Let's think step by step.
### Keywords
From the Keywords "atopic dermatitis; single-cell RNA sequencing," there is an indication that the technology 'scRNA' may be used.
### Verify
The Abstract states "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found comparable transcriptional profiles of key inflammatory pathways between blister and biopsy AD," which confirms the use of 'scRNA' as a technology in the study.
### Context
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the result without ambiguity.
### Conclusion
Consequently, we confirm 'scRNA' as our final result.
### Result
['scRNA']
