### Keywords ###
From the abstract and keywords, we identify "APEX-seq" as a key technology mentioned, which is a method used to map the spatial organization of the transcriptome.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq," and "Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-seq," which confirms the relevance of "APEX-seq" to the study described.
### Conclusion ###
Given the direct mention and use of the technology in the abstract, we can conclude that "APEX-seq" is the appropriate result.
### Result ###
['APEX-seq']
