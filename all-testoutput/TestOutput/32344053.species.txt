### Keywords
From the abstract, the terms "atopic dermatitis (AD)" and "single-cell RNA sequencing" are mentioned, suggesting that 'Homo sapiens' may be a proper result as it refers to human studies.
### Verify
The abstract explicitly states that the study involves human subjects: "We sought to characterize AD on both transcriptomic and proteomic levels in humans." This confirms that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species for the study.
### Context
The study involves analyzing skin samples and interstitial fluid from humans with atopic dermatitis, which provides further context supporting that the species is 'Homo sapiens'.
### Conclusion
Based on the keywords, verification, and contextual clues, we can conclude that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species for the study.
### Result
['Homo sapiens']
