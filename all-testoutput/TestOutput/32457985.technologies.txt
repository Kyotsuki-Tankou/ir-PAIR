### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "RNA tomography sequencing," "zebrafish," "chicken," "mouse," and "human embryos," which suggest that 'RNA-seq' and 'Embryo development' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing," which can be associated with 'RNA-seq' since RNA sequencing is a common method for genome-wide analysis. It also refers to "zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos," which supports 'Embryo development'.
### Context ###
The context of the study, which includes the use of RNA tomography sequencing on various embryos and the subsequent analysis of the aortic microenvironment, supports the conclusion that 'RNA-seq' and 'Embryo development' are relevant.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the keywords, verify, and context, we can conclude that 'RNA-seq' and 'Embryo development' are the correct results.
### Result ###
['RNA-seq', 'Embryo development']
