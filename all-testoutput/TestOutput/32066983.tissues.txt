###Keywords
From the abstract, we can extract the following keywords that could relate to the schema:
- "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)"
- "mouse SCN"
- "single-cell RNA-sequencing"
- "circadian"
- "gene expression patterns"
###Verify
The abstract states that the researchers have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify cell types in the mouse SCN and to characterize their circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns. This implies that the focus is on the SCN of a mouse, which is part of the hypothalamus.
###Context
The context provided in the abstract suggests that the research is focused on the SCN, which is a specific region within the brain. The schema includes "Brain" as a tissue, and the SCN is indeed a part of the brain.
###Conclusion
Based on the context and the verification, the tissue being studied in the input corresponds to the "Brain" in the schema.
###Result
['Brain']
