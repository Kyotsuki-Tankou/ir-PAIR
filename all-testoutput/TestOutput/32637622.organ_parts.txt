### Verify ###
The mention of "whole-brain spatial transcriptomics" and "neuroanatomical organization" directly implies that the study is focused on brain regions, which aligns with the keywords from the schema.
### Context ###
The description of identifying "spatially defining features" and the use of "molecular atlas" further reinforces the focus on brain structures.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context and the specific terms used in the abstract, the study is clearly focused on brain structures. Therefore, the schema item 'Brain' is the most appropriate match.
### Result ###
['Brain']
