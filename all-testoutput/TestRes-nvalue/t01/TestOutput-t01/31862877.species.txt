###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we can infer the focus is on "Heart failure (HF)", "aptamer-based proteomics", "circulating proteins", "pathophysiological insights", "therapeutic targets", "cardiac origins", and "systemic factors".
###Verify###
In the Abstract, we see mentions of "Heart failure (HF)", "aptamer-based proteomics", "circulating proteins", "cardiac origins", and "systemic factors". These phrases confirm the focus on heart-related research and the use of proteomics to study heart failure.
###Context###
The Abstract specifically mentions "heart" and "cardiac origins", which directly relate to the heart tissue. There is no mention of any other species, indicating a focus on humans.
###Conclusion###
The terms from the Keywords and the Abstract strongly suggest a focus on "Homo sapiens" as the species being studied, given the context of heart failure and its relevance to human health.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
