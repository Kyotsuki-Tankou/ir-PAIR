###Keywords###
- "high-definition spatial transcriptomics"
- "captures RNA from histological tissue sections"
- "spatially barcoded bead array"
- "2-μm resolution"
- "mouse brain and primary breast cancer"
###Verify###
- The input mentions "high-definition spatial transcriptomics," which could be related to several technologies in the schema.
- "captures RNA from histological tissue sections" suggests a technology involving RNA sequencing.
- "spatially barcoded bead array" and "2-μm resolution" indicate a high-resolution spatial technology.
###Context###
- The context of the input is the development of a new high-resolution spatial transcriptomics method.
- The mention of "mouse brain and primary breast cancer" indicates application areas but does not directly name a specific technology.
###Conclusion###
- The description closely aligns with "Spatial Transcriptomics" and "Slide-seqV2" from the schema, as these technologies involve capturing RNA in a spatial context with high resolution.
- "Slide-seqV2" is a specific version of "Slide-seq," which is also mentioned in the schema and fits the description of a spatially barcoded bead array.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'Slide-seqV2']
