### Keywords ###
- "Gastruloids"
- "embryonic stem cells"
- "mouse embryos"
- "somitogenesis"
### Verify ###
- "Gastruloids are three-dimensional aggregates of embryonic stem cells" confirms the presence of 'Gastruloids'.
- "Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos" confirms the presence of 'Mouse Embryo'.
- "key regulators of somitogenesis are expressed similarly between embryos and gastruloids" confirms the relevance of 'somitogenesis'.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the comparison between gastruloids and mouse embryos, particularly in the context of somitogenesis and germ-layer specification.
### Conclusion ###
- Based on the keywords and context, the relevant organ parts from the schema are 'Gastruloid', 'Mouse Embryo', and 'somitogenesis' (though 'somitogenesis' is a process, it is listed in the schema).
### Result ###
['Gastruloid', 'Mouse Embryo', 'somitogenesis']
