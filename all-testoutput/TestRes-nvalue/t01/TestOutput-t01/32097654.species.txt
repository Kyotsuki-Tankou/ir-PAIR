###Verify###
- "mouse digit tip blastemas" and "mouse digit tips" directly indicate the use of mice in the study, which corresponds to 'Mus musculus' in the schema.
###Context###
- The abstract mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas and unamputated control digit tips," which further confirms the use of mouse models in the study.
- The keywords also include "blastema; digit tip regeneration; fibroblast heterogeneity; mest; single-cell RNA-seq," all of which are related to the study conducted on mouse tissue.
###Conclusion###
Given the clear and consistent mention of "mouse" throughout the abstract and keywords, 'Mus musculus' is a definitive match.
###Result###
['Mus musculus']
