### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" are explicitly mentioned. These terms suggest the use of 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technologies.
### Verify ###
- The abstract states, "we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics," which directly verifies the use of 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
- Additionally, the keywords section includes "scRNA-seq" and "spatial transcriptomics," further confirming these technologies.
### Context ###
Since the verification step directly confirms the presence of 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to support this conclusion.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
