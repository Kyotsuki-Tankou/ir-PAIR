### Keywords ###
From the phrases "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)" and "transcriptomic profiles in tissue sections," it suggests that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "using Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) as a proof of principle approach for unbiased mRNA studies at the site of inflammation." This directly aligns with the 'Spatial Transcriptomics' technology.
### Context ###
The context further supports the use of 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as it discusses the application of ST in analyzing synovial biopsies, performing differential gene expression analysis, and overlaying gene expression data on histological images. There is no conflicting information that would suggest a different technology.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
