###Keywords###
From the abstract, keywords like "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)," "spatial transcriptomics," "primary pancreatic tumors," and "cell populations" suggest a focus on tissue analysis and cancer research. The term "Mus musculus" (mouse) is not directly mentioned in the abstract.
###Verify###
The abstract discusses "primary pancreatic tumors" and the combination of "a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method" with "scRNA-seq generated from the same sample." This implies a study on tissue samples, likely from a model organism commonly used in such research, but there is no specific mention of the species.
###Context###
Given the context of "primary pancreatic tumors" and the use of advanced techniques like scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, it is common for such studies to use model organisms like mice (Mus musculus) due to their well-characterized genetics and availability of tools for genetic manipulation.
###Conclusion###
While the abstract does not explicitly mention "Mus musculus," the context of the study and the typical use of mice in similar research suggest that it is highly likely that mice were used as the model organism.
###Result###
["Mus musculus"]
