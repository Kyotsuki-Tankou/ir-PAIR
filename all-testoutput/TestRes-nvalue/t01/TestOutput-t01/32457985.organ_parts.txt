### Keywords ###
From the input, the relevant organ parts mentioned are:
- 'Embryo' (zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos)
- 'Mouse Embryo'
- 'Human cell lines' (implied by human embryos)
- 'Mouse aorta' (aortic microenvironment)
### Verify ###
- **Embryo**: The abstract explicitly mentions "zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos."
- **Mouse Embryo**: Specifically mentioned as one of the species studied.
- **Human cell lines**: Implied by the mention of human embryos, though not directly stated.
- **Mouse aorta**: The study focuses on the "aortic microenvironment," specifically in mouse embryos.
### Context ###
- The study involves genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing on various embryos, focusing on the aortic microenvironment.
- The mention of "aortic microenvironment" directly relates to the "Mouse aorta."
- The use of human embryos implies the involvement of human cell lines, though not explicitly stated.
### Conclusion ###
- **Embryo**: Confirmed by explicit mention.
- **Mouse Embryo**: Confirmed by explicit mention.
- **Human cell lines**: Implied but not directly stated; context supports its inclusion.
- **Mouse aorta**: Confirmed by focus on the aortic microenvironment in mouse embryos.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Mouse Embryo', 'Human cell lines', 'Mouse aorta']
