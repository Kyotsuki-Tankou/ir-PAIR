###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region" and "embryo" directly indicate that 'Embryo' and 'Mouse Embryo' may be relevant results. Additionally, "dorsal aorta" suggests 'Mouse aorta' and 'Dorsal aorta' could be relevant.
###Verify###
- "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region" confirms 'Embryo' and 'Mouse Embryo'.
- "ventral domain of the dorsal aorta" confirms 'Mouse aorta' and 'Dorsal aorta'.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Embryo', 'Mouse Embryo', 'Mouse aorta', and 'Dorsal aorta' as the final results based on the clear and consistent references to these terms in the input.
###Result###
['Embryo', 'Mouse Embryo', 'Mouse aorta', 'Dorsal aorta']
