###Keywords###
- "rheumatoid arthritis (RA)"
- "spondyloarthritis (SpA)"
- "chronic inflammatory diseases"
- "synovial biopsies"
- "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)"
- "immune cell type identification"
- "adaptive immune response"
- "tissue repair"
###Verify###
- The Abstract mentions "rheumatoid arthritis (RA)" and "spondyloarthritis (SpA)" as the primary focus.
- It discusses "chronic inflammatory diseases," which aligns with RA and SpA.
- The study involves "synovial biopsies," indicating a focus on joint tissues affected by these diseases.
###Context###
- The use of "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)" for analyzing "synovial biopsies" suggests a detailed examination of the inflammatory processes in RA and SpA.
- The mention of "adaptive immune response" and "tissue repair" profiles further supports the focus on these specific diseases.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention of "rheumatoid arthritis (RA)" and "spondyloarthritis (SpA)" and the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, it is clear that these are the relevant diseases for this study.
###Result###
['Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)', 'Spondyloarthritis (SpA)', 'Chronic Inflammatory Disease']
