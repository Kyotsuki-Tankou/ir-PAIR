###Keywords###
From the phrases "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "germ layers," "cell lineages," "gastrulation," and "embryonic programming," it suggests that the study is focused on 'Embryo development'.
###Verify###
The text "Here we report a spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations at defined positions in the germ layers during development from pre- to late-gastrulation stages" further confirms that the study is indeed centered around the development stages of the embryo, specifically during gastrulation, which is a critical phase in 'Embryo development'.
###Conclusion###
Given the consistent focus on the developmental stages of the mouse embryo, particularly around germ layer formation and cell lineage specification, 'Embryo development' is the appropriate term to extract.
###Result###
['Embryo development']
