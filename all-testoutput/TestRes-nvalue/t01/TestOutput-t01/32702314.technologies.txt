###Keywords###
From the Abstract, the key phrases are "spatial transcriptomics" and "in situ sequencing". These suggest potential matches with the technologies listed in the schema.
###Verify###
- "spatial transcriptomics" directly matches 'Spatial Transcriptomics' in the schema.
- "in situ sequencing" is not explicitly listed in the schema, but it is closely related to several spatial transcriptomics technologies.
###Context###
- The Abstract mentions "spatial transcriptomics" explicitly, which is a strong indicator.
- "in situ sequencing" is a method used to confirm the findings but is not listed in the schema.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention of "spatial transcriptomics" and its direct match in the schema, we can confidently conclude that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is the appropriate technology to list.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
