###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "mouse embryo," "germ layers," "post-implantation embryo," and "visceral endoderm" are prominently mentioned. This suggests that 'Embryo' and possibly 'Gastrula' (due to the mention of gastrulation stages) may be relevant tissue types.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically discusses "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "germ layers," and "gastrulation stages." These terms directly verify that 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' are indeed relevant tissue types in this context.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' as our final results.
###Result###
['Embryo', 'Gastrula']
