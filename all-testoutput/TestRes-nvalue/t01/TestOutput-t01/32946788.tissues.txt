### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the terms "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region" and "dorsal aorta" are mentioned. From the Keywords, "embryo" is explicitly listed. This suggests that 'Embryo' and 'Dorsal aorta' may be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
- **Embryo**: The Abstract mentions "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region," which directly supports 'Embryo' as a relevant tissue.
- **Dorsal aorta**: The Abstract also mentions "ventral domain of the dorsal aorta," confirming 'Dorsal aorta' as a relevant tissue.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the results without ambiguity.
### Conclusion ###
Both 'Embryo' and 'Dorsal aorta' are confirmed as relevant tissues based on the input.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Dorsal aorta']
