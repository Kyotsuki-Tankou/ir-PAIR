###Keywords###
- Atopic dermatitis
- Skin
- Suction blistering
- Single-cell RNA sequencing
- Transcriptomic
- Proteomic
###Verify###
- The abstract mentions "skin suction blistering" and "conventional biopsies" focusing on atopic dermatitis.
- Direct mentions of "skin" and related inflammatory conditions are present.
###Context###
- The study involves sampling skin cells and interstitial fluid using suction blistering.
- The focus is on understanding the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, a skin condition.
- The comparison is made between suction blistering and conventional biopsies, both targeting skin tissues.
###Conclusion###
- The primary organ part involved in the study is "Skin," specifically in the context of atopic dermatitis.
- Other potential related terms from the schema like "Atopic dermatitis lesional skin" and "Atopic dermatitis non-lesional skin" are also relevant but less explicitly mentioned.
###Result###
["Skin", "Atopic dermatitis lesional skin", "Atopic dermatitis non-lesional skin"]
