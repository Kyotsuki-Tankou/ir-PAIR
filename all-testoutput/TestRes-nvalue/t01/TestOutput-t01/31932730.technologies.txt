### Keywords ###
From the abstract, keywords such as "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)," "spatial transcriptomics," "multimodal intersection analysis," and "primary pancreatic tumors" are prominent. These terms suggest the use of specific technologies for analyzing gene expression and tissue composition.
### Verify ###
Upon reviewing the abstract, the following technologies are explicitly mentioned:
- "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)"
- "spatial transcriptomics"
### Context ###
The abstract combines "a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method" with "scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample." This indicates the use of both "Spatial Transcriptomics" and "scRNA" technologies. The term "scRNA-seq" is a clear match for "scRNA" in the schema, and "spatial transcriptomics" directly corresponds to "Spatial Transcriptomics" in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
The abstract explicitly mentions the use of "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "spatial transcriptomics," which directly match the technologies listed in the schema.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
