###Keywords###
The abstract mentions "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus," "mouse SCN," "single-cell RNA-sequencing," "neuronal subtypes," and "spatial distribution." These terms suggest a focus on the brain, specifically the hypothalamus and its cellular components.
###Verify###
The abstract emphasizes the identification and characterization of cell types in the SCN, which is part of the brain. The terms "SCN," "ventral hypothalamus," and "neuronal subtypes" directly point to the brain as the primary tissue of interest.
###Context###
Given the clear focus on the SCN and its cellular components within the brain, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
###Conclusion###
Based on the provided schema and input, "Brain" is the appropriate result as it directly corresponds to the tissue being studied.
###Result###
["Brain"]
