###Keywords###
From the phrases "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" in the Abstract and Keywords, it indicates that 'RNA-seq' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
###Verify###
The Abstract specifically mentions:
- "Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing" which verifies 'RNA-seq'.
- "Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles" which verifies 'Spatial Transcriptomics'.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'RNA-seq' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
###Result###
['RNA-seq', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
