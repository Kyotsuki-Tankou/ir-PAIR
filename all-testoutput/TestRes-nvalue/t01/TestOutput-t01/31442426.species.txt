### Keywords ###
From the abstract, there is no direct mention of any specific species. The context focuses on RNA proximity labeling techniques and subcellular localization, which are general biological methods and do not inherently specify a particular organism.
### Verify ###
Upon re-reading the abstract, there is still no explicit mention of any species. The techniques described (APEX-seq, APEX-mass spectrometry) are broad and applicable to various organisms without specifying one.
### Context ###
Given the lack of specific species mention and the general nature of the techniques discussed, it is reasonable to conclude that the study does not focus on a single species but rather on a method applicable to multiple species.
### Conclusion ###
Since no specific species is mentioned or implied in the abstract, we cannot accurately assign any of the species listed in the schema to this study.
### Result ###
null
