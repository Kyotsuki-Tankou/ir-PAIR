### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "synovial biopsies," "rheumatoid arthritis (RA)," and "spondyloarthritis (SpA)." These suggest that 'Synovial' might be a relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "explore synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients"
- "Synovial tissue biopsies from affected joints were studied"
This directly verifies that 'Synovial' is indeed a relevant tissue.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "synovial biopsies" and "synovial tissue biopsies," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Synovial' as our final result.
### Result ###
Given the schema and the explicit mention in the abstract, the correct result should be:
