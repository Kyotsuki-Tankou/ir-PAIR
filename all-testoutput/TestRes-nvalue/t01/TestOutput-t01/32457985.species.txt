### Keywords ###
From the input, the following species are mentioned directly:
- Zebrafish
- Chicken
- Mouse
- Human
### Verify ###
We need to match these mentions to the corresponding entries in the schema:
- Zebrafish corresponds to 'Danio rerio'
- Chicken corresponds to 'Gallus gallus'
- Mouse corresponds to 'Mus musculus'
