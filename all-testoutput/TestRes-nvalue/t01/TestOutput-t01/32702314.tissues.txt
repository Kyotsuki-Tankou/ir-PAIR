###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "brain sections" and "mouse model" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Brain' may be a proper result. Additionally, "amyloid plaques" and "Alzheimer's disease" suggest a focus on neurological tissues.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections," which directly verifies the presence of 'Brain'.
- The context of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid plaques further supports the focus on brain tissue.
###Context###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific tissue (brain) where the study was conducted.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain' as our final result based on the explicit mentions and context in the abstract.
###Result###
['Brain']
