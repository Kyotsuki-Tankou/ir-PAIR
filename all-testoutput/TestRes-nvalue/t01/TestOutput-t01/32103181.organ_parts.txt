###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "tumour," "cancer," "T cells," and "peripheral blood" are prominent. However, specific organ parts are not explicitly mentioned.
###Verify###
The abstract discusses T cells in the context of tumours, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood, but it does not specify particular organ parts from the given schema.
###Context###
To further clarify, the abstract focuses on the mechanisms of anti-PDL1 therapy and T cell distribution in cancer patients, which is a broad and systemic approach rather than focusing on specific organ parts.
###Conclusion###
Given the lack of specific mention of organ parts from the schema in the abstract, we cannot conclusively identify any specific organ parts related to the study.
###Result###
null
