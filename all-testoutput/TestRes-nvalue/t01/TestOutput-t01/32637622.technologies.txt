### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "whole-brain spatial transcriptomics" is explicitly mentioned, which suggests the use of a specific technology for mapping the brain.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "employing whole-brain spatial transcriptomics," which directly verifies the use of "Spatial Transcriptomics" as a technology in the study.
### Context ###
Since the verification step directly confirms the presence of "Spatial Transcriptomics" in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to support this conclusion.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
