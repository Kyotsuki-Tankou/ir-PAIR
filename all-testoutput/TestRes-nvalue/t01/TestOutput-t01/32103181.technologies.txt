###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell sequencing of RNA" and "T cell receptors" suggest potential matches with technologies like 'scRNA', 'RNA-seq', and possibly others related to single-cell analysis.
###Verify###
1. **"single-cell sequencing of RNA"**:
   - This phrase directly corresponds to 'scRNA' in the schema.
2. **"T cell receptors"**:
   - This suggests a focus on specific cellular components, but does not directly match any technology in the schema.
###Context###
- The abstract mentions "performing deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors," which strongly indicates the use of 'scRNA' technology.
- There is no explicit mention of other technologies listed in the schema.
###Conclusion###
Based on the clear mention of "single-cell sequencing of RNA," we can confidently conclude that 'scRNA' is the technology used. There is no sufficient evidence to suggest the use of other technologies listed in the schema.
###Result###
['scRNA']
