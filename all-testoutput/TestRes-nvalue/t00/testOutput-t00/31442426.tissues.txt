### Verify ###
- **Stress granules**: Mentioned explicitly in the text.
- **Transcriptome**: Mentioned in the context of APEX-seq.
- **Proteome**: Mentioned in the context of APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS).
### Context ###
- The paper discusses the development and application of APEX-seq to study the spatial organization of the transcriptome.
- It highlights the localization of RNAs within the cell and their interaction with RNA-binding proteins.
- The technique is used to explore the composition of stress granules and translation initiation complexes.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary focus is on cellular structures and processes rather than specific tissues.
### Result ###
- **null** (No specific tissues mentioned in the input text corresponding to the schema.)
