### Context ###
The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind the success of antibodies that block PD1 and PDL1 in cancer treatment. It involves deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors in patients with different types of cancer to analyze T cell populations and their distribution in tumours, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood. The findings suggest that clonotypic expansion of effector-like T cells is a key factor in patient response to anti-PDL1 therapy and that intratumoural T cells are replenished from outside the tumour, indicating ongoing cancer immunity cycle activity.
### Conclusion ###
The study primarily deals with various types of cancer and the immune response mechanisms, particularly focusing on T cells and their interaction with PD1 and PDL1.
