### Context
- The study focuses on atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin condition.
- Methods include suction blistering and conventional biopsies.
- Analysis involves both transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and proteomic (Olink proteomics) levels.
- Key findings relate to differences in cell capture and resolution between methods, and specific cellular and molecular characteristics of AD.
### Conclusion
- The study primarily deals with skin (specifically atopic dermatitis) and various cellular and molecular aspects related to it.
- Techniques like suction blistering and biopsies are used to sample skin cells and interstitial fluid.
### Result
- **['Skin', 'Atopic dermatitis lesional skin']**
