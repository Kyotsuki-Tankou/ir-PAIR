### Verify ###
- Heart failure (HF): Mentioned as the main focus.
- Circulating proteins: Mentioned as the subject of study.
- Aptamer-based proteomics: Mentioned as the method used.
- Immunological, complement, coagulation, natriuretic, and matrix remodeling pathways: Mentioned as pathways studied.
- Coronary sinus samples: Mentioned as a source of samples.
- Transcriptomic tools: Mentioned as tools used.
- Cardiac origins, specific cellular origins: Mentioned in the context of protein origins.
- Nt-proBNP, thrombospondin-2, interleukin-18 receptor, gelsolin, activated C5: Mentioned as specific proteins studied.
### Context ###
The paper focuses on the systematic characterization of circulating proteins in different stages of heart failure (HF) using aptamer-based proteomics. It explores various pathways and identifies specific proteins, their origins, and changes across different stages of HF, including post-heart transplantation.
### Conclusion ###
The paper primarily deals with heart-related tissues and proteins. The specific organ parts mentioned or implied are related to the heart and its associated systems.
### Result ###
- Heart
- Coronary sinus samples
- Cardiac origins
- Specific cellular origins
