### Verify ###
- RA and SpA are both chronic inflammatory diseases.
- ST is used to analyze transcriptomic profiles in tissue sections.
- DEA and immune cell type identification are methods used in the study.
- The study focuses on understanding cellular mechanisms and diversity in chronic inflammatory diseases.
### Context ###
- The study specifically mentions "chronic inflammatory diseases" and focuses on RA and SpA.
- The use of ST technology to analyze synovial biopsies indicates a detailed examination of inflammatory processes.
- The findings highlight differences in immune response profiles between RA and SpA, particularly in terms of T cell subsets.
### Conclusion ###
- The study is primarily focused on understanding the cellular mechanisms and immune responses in chronic inflammatory diseases, specifically RA and SpA.
### Result ###
- ['Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)', 'Spondyloarthritis (SpA)', 'Chronic Inflammatory Disease']
