- **Tumor**: Mentioned as "cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)" and "tumor subpopulations"
- **Epithelium**: Implied by "epidermal states" and "tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK)"
- **Blood vessel**: Implied by "fibrovascular niche"
- **Cell line**: Mentioned in the context of "human tumor xenografts"
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the cellular composition and architecture of cSCC, involving both normal skin and tumor tissues.
- Techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed ion beam imaging are used.
- The presence of tumor-specific keratinocytes and their interaction in a fibrovascular niche is highlighted.
- Immunological aspects, such as T regulatory cells and CD8 T cells, are discussed in the context of tumor stroma.
### Conclusion ###
- The study primarily deals with skin tissues, both normal and cancerous.
- It involves detailed analysis of tumor subpopulations and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment.
### Result ###
