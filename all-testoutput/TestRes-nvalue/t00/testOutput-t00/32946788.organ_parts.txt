### Keywords ###
- AGM region
- HSC (Hematopoietic stem cells)
- Embryo
- Endothelin
- Hematopoiesis
- Single cell transcriptome
- Spatial transcriptome
### Verify ###
- **AGM region**: Mentioned in the text as "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region".
- **HSC (Hematopoietic stem cells)**: Mentioned as "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)".
- **Embryo**: Implied by the context of "embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region".
- **Endothelin**: Mentioned as "endothelin 1".
- **Hematopoiesis**: Implied by the context of "HSC development".
- **Single cell transcriptome**: Mentioned as "single cells" in the context of gene expression profiling.
- **Spatial transcriptome**: Mentioned as "spatial transcriptomics analysis".
### Context ###
- The text focuses on the development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the embryonic AGM region.
- It involves spatial transcriptomics and gene expression profiling to identify secreted signals, particularly endothelin 1, which regulate HSC development.
### Conclusion ###
- The keywords extracted are relevant and accurately reflect the main components and methodologies discussed in the text.
### Result ###
- ['Embryo', 'AGM region', 'HSC', 'Endothelin', 'Single cell transcriptome', 'Spatial transcriptome']
