### Context ###
The study focuses on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus of mice, using single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify cell types and their gene expression patterns related to circadian rhythms and light responsiveness. The creation of a standardized SCN atlas and the observation of spatiotemporal gene regulation patterns are key outcomes.
### Conclusion ###
The study primarily revolves around the brain, specifically the SCN and its role in circadian rhythms. No direct mention of any diseases from the schema is made.
### Result ###
null
