### Context ###
- The study focuses on atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin disease.
- Methods include suction blistering and conventional biopsies.
- Analyses involve both transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and proteomic (Olink proteomics) approaches.
- Key findings include differences in cell capture between methods and specific upregulation of cytokines and proteins in AD.
### Conclusion ###
- The study primarily involves **Skin** as the tissue of interest.
- Other relevant tissues/cells include **Immune cells**, **Epidermal cells**, **Myeloid cells**, **Dendritic cells**, and **Macrophages**.
