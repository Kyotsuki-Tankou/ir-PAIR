### Keywords ###
- **Organ Parts**: 'aortic microenvironment', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'zebrafish', 'chicken', 'mouse', 'human embryos'
### Verify ###
- **Organ Parts**: 
  - 'aortic microenvironment' -> **Closest Match**: 'Mouse aorta'
  - 'hematopoietic stem cells' -> **Closest Match**: 'IPS cells' (as they can differentiate into various cell types including hematopoietic cells)
  - 'zebrafish', 'chicken', 'mouse', 'human embryos' -> **Closest Match**: 'Embryo'
### Context ###
- The context involves the study of the aortic microenvironment in various embryos (zebrafish, chicken, mouse, human) to understand the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell generation. This suggests a focus on embryonic structures and specific microenvironments related to blood cell formation.
### Conclusion ###
- Based on the context and the closest matches, the relevant organ parts are 'Mouse aorta', 'IPS cells', and 'Embryo'.
### Result ###
['Mouse aorta', 'IPS cells', 'Embryo']
