- Circulating proteins
- Aptamer-based proteomics
- Immunological, complement, coagulation, natriuretic, matrix remodeling pathways
- Coronary sinus samples
- Transcriptomic tools
- Cardiac origins
- Specific cellular origins
- Nt-proBNP, thrombospondin-2, interleukin-18 receptor, gelsolin, activated C5
### Verify ###
- Heart: Mentioned multiple times in context of heart failure and cardiac origins.
- Blood: Mentioned in context of circulating proteins and coronary sinus samples.
- Coronary sinus: Specific mention of coronary sinus samples.
- Cardiac cells: Implied through discussion of cardiac origins of proteins.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on heart failure and the proteins associated with it.
- Coronary sinus samples are used to identify the origin of these proteins.
- The mention of specific proteins like Nt-proBNP, thrombospondin-2, etc., suggests a detailed look into cardiac and systemic factors.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary tissue types mentioned and relevant to the study are "Heart" and "Blood".
- "Coronary sinus" is a specific part of the cardiovascular system, but it can be grouped under "Heart" for broader categorization.
- "Cardiac cells" are implied but not explicitly mentioned; they can be considered under "Heart".
### Result ###
["Heart", "Blood"]
