- standardized SCN atlas: Created from the study.
### Context ###
The study focuses on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the mouse brain, specifically within the ventral hypothalamus. The use of single-cell RNA-sequencing allowed the identification of various neuronal subtypes within the SCN, each with distinct circadian gene expression patterns. The spatial distribution of these subtypes was mapped through a three-dimensional reconstruction, resulting in a standardized SCN atlas.
### Conclusion ###
The study primarily deals with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and its neuronal subtypes within the mouse brain, particularly focusing on their circadian gene expression and spatial distribution.
### Result ###
["suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)", "ventral hypothalamus", "mouse SCN", "circadian gene expression", "neuronal subtypes", "spatial distribution", "three-dimensional reconstruction", "standardized SCN atlas"]
