  - Visceral endoderm
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the early stages of mouse embryo development, particularly post-implantation.
- It involves the transition of cells from naive to primed pluripotent states.
- Germ layers and cell lineages are specified during gastrulation.
- The research provides a spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations in the germ layers.
- The transcriptome reveals molecular genealogy and pluripotency states.
- Hippo-Yap signalling is mentioned in the context of germ-layer development.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary tissues involved in the study are related to early embryonic development, specifically the germ layers and their derivatives.
### Result ###
- ['Embryo', 'Germ layers', 'Epiblast', 'Endoderm', 'Visceral endoderm']
