### Keywords ###
- APEX-Seq
- RNA localization
- proximity labeling
- subcellular localization
### Verify ###
- The input text mentions "APEX-seq" which matches "APEX-Seq" in keywords.
- "RNA localization" is explicitly mentioned in the text.
- "proximity labeling" is also mentioned as part of the technique developed.
- "subcellular localization" is implied by the discussion of RNAs localizing to specific regions of the cell.
### Context ###
- The text discusses the use of APEX-seq to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome.
- It mentions the localization of RNAs within the cell and their interaction with RNA-binding proteins.
- The technique is used to study translation initiation complexes and stress granule composition.
### Conclusion ###
- The keywords extracted are relevant and accurately reflect the main themes of the input text.
### Result ###
null
