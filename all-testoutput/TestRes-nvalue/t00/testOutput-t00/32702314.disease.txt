### Verify ###
- Alzheimer’s disease: Mentioned in the abstract as the primary focus.
- amyloid plaque: Described as the central feature around which changes are observed.
- astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte: These cell types are implied by the context of brain tissue and myelination.
- cellular phase: Implied by the discussion of cellular interactions and changes.
- complement cascade: Mentioned in the context of plaque-induced genes (PIGs).
- in situ sequencing: Used as a method to confirm alterations.
- myelination: Mentioned in relation to early alterations in gene co-expression networks.
- spatial transcriptomics: Used as the primary method of investigation.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on molecular changes and cellular interactions around amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
- Early alterations involve myelin and oligodendrocyte genes, while later phases involve a multicellular network including the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation.
- The study uses spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing to analyze these changes.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary disease focus is Alzheimer's disease.
- Other relevant terms include amyloid plaque, astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte, and related processes like myelination and complement cascade.
### Result ###
- ["Alzheimer’s disease", "amyloid plaque", "astrocyte", "microglia", "oligodendrocyte", "myelination", "complement cascade"]
