### Verify ###
- **Tissues**: The input mentions "aortic microenvironment" and "hematopoietic stem cells," which are related to blood and vascular systems. Specifically, "Dorsal aorta" and "Blood" from the schema are directly relevant.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the aortic microenvironment where hematopoietic stem cells are generated. This context aligns with the "Dorsal aorta" and "Blood" tissues in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
- The relevant tissues extracted from the input based on the schema are "Dorsal aorta" and "Blood."
### Result ###
["Dorsal aorta", "Blood"]
