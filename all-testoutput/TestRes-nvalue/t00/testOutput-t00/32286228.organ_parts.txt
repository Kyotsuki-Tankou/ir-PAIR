### Context ###
- The study focuses on the identification and characterization of a unique subpopulation of cells within the bone marrow mesenchymal lineage, termed marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs).
- These cells express adipocyte markers but lack lipid droplets and are abundant as pericytes and stromal cells within the marrow cavity.
- The study employed single cell RNA-seq to analyze these cells in young, adult, and aging mice.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary organ part discussed in the input is "Bone marrow."
### Result ###
- ["Bone marrow"]
