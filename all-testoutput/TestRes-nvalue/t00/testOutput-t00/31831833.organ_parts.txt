### Verify ###
- Synovial tissue biopsies from affected joints were studied.
- The focus is on RA and SpA patients.
- Techniques used include ST, DEA, pathway analysis, Xcell analysis, and IHC.
- Analysis of mononuclear cell infiltrates and immune response profiles.
### Context ###
- The study involves analyzing specific tissue sections (synovial biopsies) from patients with RA and SpA.
- The techniques employed are aimed at understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms in these tissues.
- The findings highlight differences in immune cell types and interactions between RA and SpA.
### Conclusion ###
- The study focuses on synovial tissue, which is relevant to understanding the pathology of RA and SpA.
### Result ###
- **['Synovial tissue']**
