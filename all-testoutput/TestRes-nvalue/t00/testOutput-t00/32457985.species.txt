### Context ###
- The study focuses on the aortic microenvironment where the first hematopoietic stem cells are generated during development.
- Genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing was performed on embryos of zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human.
- The study aimed to explore the molecular characteristics and key components of the aortic microenvironment.
- Interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses and functional assays were conducted to understand the complexity and regulation of hematopoietic stem cell generation.
### Conclusion ###
- The species mentioned in the input that correspond to the schema are: zebrafish (Danio rerio), chicken (Gallus gallus), mouse (Mus musculus), and human (Homo sapiens).
### Result ###
