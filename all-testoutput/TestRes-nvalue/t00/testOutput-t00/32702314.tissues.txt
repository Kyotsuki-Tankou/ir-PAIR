### Verify ###
- Alzheimer’s disease: Mentioned in the abstract.
- amyloid plaque: Mentioned in the abstract.
- astrocyte: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
- cellular phase: Implied by discussion of transcriptional changes and cellular interactions.
- complement cascade: Mentioned in the abstract.
- in situ sequencing: Mentioned in the abstract.
- microglia: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
- myelination: Mentioned in the context of myelin and oligodendrocyte genes.
- oligodendrocyte: Mentioned in the abstract.
- spatial transcriptomics: Mentioned in the abstract.
### Context ###
- The abstract discusses the investigation of transcriptional changes in tissue domains around amyloid plaques in an AD mouse model using spatial transcriptomics.
- It highlights early alterations in genes related to myelin and oligodendrocytes and later changes involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation.
- The study confirms these alterations at the cellular level using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections.
### Conclusion ###
- The primary focus is on the brain tissue, specifically around amyloid plaques.
- Astrocytes and microglia are not explicitly mentioned but are relevant cellular components in the context of Alzheimer's disease and brain tissue.
### Result ###
- ['Brain']
