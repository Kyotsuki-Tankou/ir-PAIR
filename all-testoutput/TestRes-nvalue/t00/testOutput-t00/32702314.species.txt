### Keywords ###
- Alzheimer’s disease
- amyloid plaque
- astrocyte
- cellular phase
- complement cascade
- in situ sequencing
- microglia
- myelination
- oligodendrocyte
- spatial transcriptomics
### Verify ###
- **Alzheimer’s disease**: Mentioned in the abstract.
- **amyloid plaque**: Mentioned in the abstract.
- **astrocyte**: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
- **cellular phase**: Implied by "multicellular gene co-expression network".
- **complement cascade**: Mentioned in the context of "complement system".
- **in situ sequencing**: Mentioned in the abstract.
- **microglia**: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
- **myelination**: Implied by "myelin and oligodendrocyte genes".
- **oligodendrocyte**: Mentioned in the abstract.
- **spatial transcriptomics**: Mentioned in the abstract.
### Context ###
- The abstract mentions "multicellular gene co-expression network" which may imply involvement of various cell types including astrocytes and microglia, even though they are not explicitly named.
### Conclusion ###
- The keywords "astrocyte" and "microglia" are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract but are inferred from the context of multicellular interactions and brain tissue studies.
### Result ###
['Mus musculus', 'Homo sapiens']
