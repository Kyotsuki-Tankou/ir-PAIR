### Keywords ###
- AGM region
- HSC (Hematopoietic stem cells)
- Embryo
- Endothelin
- Hematopoiesis
- Single cell transcriptome
- Spatial transcriptome
### Verify ###
- **AGM region**: Mentioned in the text as the location where HSCs first emerge.
- **HSC**: Central to the study, discussed extensively.
- **Embryo**: Context of HSC emergence.
- **Endothelin**: Identified as a key regulator in the study.
- **Hematopoiesis**: Process being studied (development of HSCs).
- **Single cell transcriptome**: Method used for analysis.
- **Spatial transcriptome**: Another method used for analysis.
### Context ###
- The study focuses on the development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the embryonic AGM region.
- It involves analyzing signaling pathways and gene expression profiles.
- Endothelin 1 is highlighted as a significant regulator.
### Conclusion ###
- The study is primarily about the development of HSCs in the embryonic context.
- It does not directly mention any specific diseases from the schema.
### Result ###
- **null** 
The extracted keywords do not directly correspond to any diseases listed in the schema, so the result is an empty list, represented as 'null'.
