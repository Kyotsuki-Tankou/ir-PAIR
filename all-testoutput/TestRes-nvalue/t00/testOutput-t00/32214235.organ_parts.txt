### Verify ###
- **Human organs**: The study focuses on human organs, which could include various organ parts listed in the schema.
- **Single-cell hierarchy**: This implies detailed analysis of different tissues, potentially covering multiple organ parts.
- **Comparative analysis (human and mouse)**: This suggests involvement of mouse-related organ parts as well.
### Context ###
- The paper discusses a comprehensive single-cell atlas for humans, indicating a wide range of human tissues and organs.
- It also mentions a comparative analysis with mouse tissues, which could include various mouse-related organ parts.
### Conclusion ###
- The study likely involves multiple organ parts from both humans and mice, given its comprehensive nature and comparative analysis.
