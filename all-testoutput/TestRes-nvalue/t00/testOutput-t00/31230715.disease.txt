### Context ###
- The abstract discusses a method for RNA sequencing (APEX-seq) and its application in mapping the human transcriptome at a nanometer-resolution.
- It mentions the radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome and pathways of mRNA localization to mitochondria.
- The focus is on the technical aspects and potential applications of APEX-seq in various systems, rather than on specific diseases.
### Conclusion ###
- None of the keywords directly correspond to any diseases listed in the schema.
- The context of the paper is more about methodology and general biological processes rather than specific diseases.
### Result ###
null
