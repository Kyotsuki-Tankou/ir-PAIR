### Context
- The study focuses on the cardiac morphogenesis process in humans.
- It involves exploring gene expression in the embryonic heart at three developmental stages.
- Techniques used include single-cell RNA sequencing and in situ sequencing.
- The goal is to map cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains.
### Conclusion
The study primarily revolves around the heart and its development, particularly in the embryonic stages.
