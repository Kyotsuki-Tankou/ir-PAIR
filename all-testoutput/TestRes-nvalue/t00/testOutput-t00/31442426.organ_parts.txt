### Keywords ###
- APEX-seq
- RNA localization
- Proximity labeling
- Subcellular localization
### Verify ###
- **APEX-seq**: Mentioned in the text as an RNA proximity labeling technique.
- **RNA localization**: Described as a key aspect of the study, focusing on the spatial organization of the transcriptome.
- **Proximity labeling**: Used in the context of APEX-seq to probe the spatial organization.
- **Subcellular localization**: Implied by the discussion on resolving the localization of RNAs within the cell.
### Context ###
- The study involves mapping RNA composition in non-membrane-bound structures like stress granules.
- APEX-seq is developed to determine RNA localization and their interaction with RNA-binding proteins.
- The technique is compared with APEX-mass spectrometry to gain insights into translation initiation complexes and stress granule composition.
### Conclusion ###
- The keywords accurately reflect the main themes and techniques discussed in the abstract.
### Result ###
- **organ_parts**: null
The abstract does not mention any specific organ parts from the provided schema. Therefore, the extracted list for `organ_parts` is empty, and we return 'null'.
