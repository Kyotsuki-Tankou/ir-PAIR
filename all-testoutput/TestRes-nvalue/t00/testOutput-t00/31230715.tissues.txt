### Verify
- **Subcellular locales**: Mentioned explicitly.
- **Human transcriptome**: Mentioned explicitly.
- **Nuclear transcriptome**: Mentioned explicitly.
- **Cytoplasmic export**: Mentioned explicitly.
- **Messenger RNA**: Mentioned explicitly.
- **Mitochondria**: Mentioned explicitly.
### Context
- The paper discusses APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing that provides spatial mapping of the human transcriptome at a nanometer resolution.
- It highlights the radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome and the export of processed transcripts through the nuclear pore.
- It also identifies pathways for mRNA localization to mitochondria, associated with specific transcripts for building macromolecular machines.
### Conclusion
- The primary focus is on subcellular locales, particularly the nucleus and mitochondria, within the context of the human transcriptome.
### Result
- ['Nuclear', 'Mitochondria']
