### Verify ###
- Tumour immunity: Mentioned in the context of understanding the mechanisms of anti-PDL1 therapy.
- T cells: Central to the study, discussed in terms of clonotypes and their distribution.
- Clonotypes: Highlighted as a key focus for understanding T cell distribution.
- Cancer: The context of the study, specifically different types of cancer.
- Anti-PDL1 therapy: Discussed in relation to patient response.
- Intratumoural T cells: Studied in detail for their profiles and expansion.
- Peripheral blood: Mentioned as a site where expanded clonotypes can be detected.
- Normal adjacent tissue: Studied alongside tumour tissue for clonotypic expansion.
### Context ###
- The study involves deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors.
- The focus is on understanding the distribution of T cell clonotypes in various tissues (tumour, normal adjacent tissue, peripheral blood).
- The findings suggest that clonotypic expansion in tumour and normal adjacent tissue is linked to better response to anti-PDL1 therapy.
- Detection of expanded clonotypes in peripheral blood offers a potential approach for patient identification.
### Conclusion ###
- The study primarily revolves around T cells and their clonotypes in the context of cancer and anti-PDL1 therapy.
- The tissues of interest include tumour, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood.
### Result ###
- ['Tumour', 'Normal adjacent tissue', 'Peripheral blood']
