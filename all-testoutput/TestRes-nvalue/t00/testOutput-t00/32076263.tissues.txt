### Context ###
- The study involves comparing mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos.
- Techniques used include single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics.
- The focus is on identifying embryonic cell types and key regulators of somitogenesis.
- Live imaging shows the somitogenesis clock in gastruloids.
- Experimental manipulations include reduced FGF signalling and embedding in Matrigel.
### Conclusion ###
- The study primarily involves tissues related to embryonic development.
### Result ###
- ['Embryo', 'Gastrula', 'Bone marrow', 'Cell line']
