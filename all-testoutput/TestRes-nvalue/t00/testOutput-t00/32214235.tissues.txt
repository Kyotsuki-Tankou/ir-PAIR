### Keywords ###
- Single-cell analysis
- Human organs
- Human cell landscape (HCL)
- Tissues
- Cell-type composition
- Single-cell hierarchy
- Human cell identity
- Comparative analysis (human and mouse)
- Stem and progenitor cells
- Differentiated cells
### Verify ###
- Tissues mentioned implicitly: All major human organs, various tissues (not specified individually)
### Context ###
- The paper discusses a comprehensive analysis of human cell types across all major organs, implying a wide range of tissues are involved. However, specific tissues are not individually listed in the abstract.
### Conclusion ###
- Given the comprehensive nature of the study covering all major human organs, it is reasonable to infer that a broad spectrum of tissues from the schema could be involved, but specific tissues are not explicitly mentioned.
### Result ###
null
