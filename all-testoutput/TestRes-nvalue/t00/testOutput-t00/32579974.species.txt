### Verify
- The input mentions "human cSCCs and matched normal skin," indicating the study involves **Homo sapiens**.
- No other species are explicitly mentioned in the input.
### Context
- The study focuses on human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).
- Techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed ion beam imaging are used.
- The study involves human tumor xenografts, which typically use human cancer cells in a model organism, but the specific model organism is not mentioned.
### Conclusion
- The primary species involved in the study is **Homo sapiens**.
### Result
- ["Homo sapiens"]
