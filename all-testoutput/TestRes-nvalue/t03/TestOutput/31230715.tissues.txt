### Keywords ###
From the Keywords, we have terms like "LADs", "OXPHOS", "UTRs", "cycloheximide", "motifs", "nocodazole", "retrotransposons", "spatial transcriptomics", and "translation". These terms suggest a focus on subcellular structures and processes rather than specific tissues.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "nine distinct subcellular locales" and "human transcriptome," indicating a focus on subcellular components rather than whole tissues. There is no direct mention of any specific tissue from the provided schema.
### Context ###
Given the lack of specific tissue mentions and the focus on subcellular locales, we need to ensure that no tissue is implied by the context. The terms used in the Abstract and Keywords are more related to cellular and molecular biology rather than specific tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context and the specific focus on subcellular components rather than whole tissues, we conclude that there are no specific tissues mentioned that correspond to the provided schema.
### Result ###
null
