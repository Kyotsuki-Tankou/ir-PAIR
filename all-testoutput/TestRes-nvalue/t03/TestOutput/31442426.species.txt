###Keywords###
From the abstract, there are no direct mentions of specific species. However, the focus is on a general technique (APEX-seq) for studying RNA localization and subcellular organization, which suggests it could be applicable to multiple species.
###Verify###
The abstract does not specify any particular species as the focus of the study. It discusses a broad technique that could be used in various biological contexts.
###Context###
Given the lack of specific species mentions and the broad applicability of the technique described, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
###Conclusion###
Since the abstract does not mention any specific species and the technique described is generally applicable, we cannot definitively match it to any of the given species options in the schema.
###Result###
null
