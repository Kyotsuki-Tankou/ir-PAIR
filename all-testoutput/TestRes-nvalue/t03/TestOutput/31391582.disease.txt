### Keywords ###
The keywords that stand out are "post-implantation development," "mouse embryo," "pluripotent state," "gastrulation," "tissue architecture," and "lineage segregation," which suggest that 'Embryo development' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, phrases like "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "cells in different regions of the germ layers acquire location-specific cell fates during gastrulation," and "spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations at defined positions in the germ layers during development from pre- to late-gastrulation stages" further verify that 'Embryo development' is indeed a relevant and proper result.
### Context ###
There is no need for additional context as the abstract clearly and consistently focuses on the development stages of the mouse embryo, specifically during gastrulation and the establishment of tissue architecture.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Embryo development' as the final result based on the clear and direct references in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Embryo development']
