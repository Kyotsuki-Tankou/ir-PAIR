###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "APEX-seq" directly suggests that 'APEX-seq' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2." This statement clearly indicates the use of 'APEX-seq' technology, further verifying that 'APEX-seq' is indeed a proper result.
###Context###
Since the term "APEX-seq" is explicitly mentioned and directly corresponds to 'APEX-seq' in the schema, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'APEX-seq' as our final result based on the clear and direct mention of the technology used in the abstract.
###Result###
['APEX-seq']
