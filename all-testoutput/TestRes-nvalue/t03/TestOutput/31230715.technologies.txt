###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "APEX-seq" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'APEX-seq' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
- The abstract states: "We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2," which directly verifies the presence of 'APEX-seq'.
###Context###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific technology being introduced and utilized.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'APEX-seq' as our final result based on the explicit mention in the abstract.
###Result###
['APEX-seq']
