### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "the process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans"
- "the embryonic heart at three developmental stages"
- "human embryonic cardiac cell types"
- "a spatial subcellular map for the three developmental phases of the human heart"
These phrases directly verify that 'Heart' is indeed the relevant tissue.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "human embryonic heart" and "heart development," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this tissue.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit and consistent mention of the heart in various contexts within the abstract, we can confidently conclude that 'Heart' is the correct tissue to be extracted.
### Result ###
