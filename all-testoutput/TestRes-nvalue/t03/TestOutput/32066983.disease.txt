### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the key terms are "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)" and "circadian behaviors." These terms suggest a focus on the brain and its role in regulating circadian rhythms.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN" and "characterize their circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns." This indicates a study focused on the functional roles of different cell types within the SCN, which is part of the brain.
### Context ###
To further verify, we need to infer from the context:
- "We identified eight major cell types, with each type displaying a specific pattern of circadian gene expression."
- "Five SCN neuronal subtypes, each with specific combinations of markers, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light responsiveness."
This detailed analysis of cell types and their functions within the SCN aligns with studies on brain development and function, particularly in the context of circadian rhythms.
### Conclusion ###
Given the focus on the SCN and its role in circadian behaviors, it is reasonable to conclude that "Brain development" and "Brain Cortex" are the relevant diseases or conditions being studied, as they encompass the development and function of brain regions involved in circadian regulation.
### Result ###
['Brain development', 'Brain Cortex']
