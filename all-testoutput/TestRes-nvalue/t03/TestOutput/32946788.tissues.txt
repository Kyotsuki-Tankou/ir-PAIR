###Keywords###
From the Keywords, we identify "AGM region," "embryo," and "dorsal aorta." These terms suggest potential tissues involved in the study.
###Verify###
The Abstract mentions:
- "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region."
- "predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta."
These statements directly verify the involvement of "Embryo" and "Dorsal aorta."
###Context###
Not required in this case as the Keywords and Verify steps align well and provide sufficient evidence.
###Conclusion###
Based on the direct mentions in both the Keywords and the Abstract, we can conclude that "Embryo" and "Dorsal aorta" are the relevant tissues.
###Result###
['Embryo', 'Dorsal aorta']
