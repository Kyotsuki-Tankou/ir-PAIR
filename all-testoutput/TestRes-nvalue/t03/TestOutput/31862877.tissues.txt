### Keywords ###
From the input, the term "heart failure (HF)" is prominently mentioned, indicating that 'Heart' might be a relevant tissue.
### Verify ###
The abstract focuses on:
- "Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem characterized by inability of the heart to maintain sufficient output of blood."
- "By leveraging coronary sinus samples and transcriptomic tools, we describe likely cardiac and specific cellular origins for several of the proteins..."
These statements clearly verify that 'Heart' is indeed a relevant tissue in the context of the study.
### Context ###
Not required in this case as the keywords and the abstract content directly align with the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Heart' as our final result based on the clear and consistent information provided in both the keywords and the abstract.
### Result ###
['Heart']
