### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the terms "single-cell mRNA sequencing" and "single-cell HCL analysis" are mentioned, indicating potential relevance to technologies like 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq'.
### Verify ###
- The phrase "single-cell mRNA sequencing" directly aligns with 'scRNA'.
- The term "single-cell" in the context of sequencing also suggests 'scRNA'.
- Additionally, "mRNA sequencing" can be associated with 'RNA-seq'.
### Context ###
- The Abstract focuses on single-cell analysis and mRNA sequencing, which are core aspects of 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq'.
- There is no mention of other specific technologies from the schema, making 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq' the most relevant.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear mention of single-cell mRNA sequencing and the focus on single-cell analysis, both 'scRNA' and 'RNA-seq' are confirmed as relevant technologies.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'RNA-seq']
