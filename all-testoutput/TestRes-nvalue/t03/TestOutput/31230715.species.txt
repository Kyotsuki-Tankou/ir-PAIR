###Keywords###
From the Abstract, the term "human transcriptome" indicates that 'Homo sapiens' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The Abstract mentions "APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome," which directly verifies that 'Homo sapiens' is indeed a proper result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the final result.
###Result###
['Homo sapiens']
