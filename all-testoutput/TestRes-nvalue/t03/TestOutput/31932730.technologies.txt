### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "spatial transcriptomics method" are prominently mentioned. These terms suggest the use of technologies related to RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method." From the schema, "scRNA" and "Spatial Transcriptomics" directly correspond to these mentions.
### Context ###
The abstract describes a method that combines scRNA-seq with a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics approach. This combination suggests the use of both "scRNA" for single-cell RNA sequencing and "Spatial Transcriptomics" for spatially resolving gene expression patterns. There is no need for additional context as the mentions are clear and directly align with the technologies in the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions and the described methodology, we can confirm that both "scRNA" and "Spatial Transcriptomics" are the correct technologies used in the study.
### Result ###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
