### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keyword "mouse model" and "human brain sections" suggest that 'Mus musculus' and 'Homo sapiens' might be the species used in the study.
### Verify ###
- "in an AD mouse model" explicitly mentions "mouse," which is a common term for 'Mus musculus'.
- "using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections" explicitly mentions both "mouse" and "human," indicating the use of 'Mus musculus' and 'Homo sapiens'.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of both "mouse" and "human" in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that 'Mus musculus' and 'Homo sapiens' are the correct species to be extracted.
