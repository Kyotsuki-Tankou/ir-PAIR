###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "mouse and human brain sections" suggests that 'Brain' may be a proper result.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "We investigate here, in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in a 100-Î¼m diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics." This statement clearly indicates that the study focuses on brain tissue, further verifying that 'Brain' is indeed a proper result.
###Context###
Since the term "mouse and human brain sections" is explicitly mentioned and directly corresponds to 'Brain' in the schema, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we confirm 'Brain' as our final result based on the clear and direct mention of the tissue type used in the abstract.
###Result###
['Brain']
