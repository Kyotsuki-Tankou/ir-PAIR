### Keywords ###
From the mention of "gastruloids" and "mouse embryos" in the Abstract, it suggests that 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' might be relevant tissues.
### Verify ###
- **Embryo**: The Abstract mentions "mouse embryos" directly, indicating that 'Embryo' is a relevant tissue.
- **Gastrula**: The term "gastruloids" refers to structures that mimic aspects of gastrulation, a key phase in embryonic development, suggesting that 'Gastrula' is also relevant.
### Context ###
- The study compares "mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos," explicitly involving both gastruloids and embryos.
- Gastruloids are described as mimicking key features of mammalian development post-implantation, aligning with the concept of gastrulation.
### Conclusion ###
Given the direct mentions and the context of the study, both 'Embryo' and 'Gastrula' are appropriate tissues to be extracted from the input.
### Result ###
['Embryo', 'Gastrula']
