### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "tumours," "normal adjacent tissue," and "peripheral blood" are mentioned in the context of cancer and T cell distribution. These terms suggest potential organ parts related to cancer and immune response.
### Verify ###
- **Tumours**: This term is general and could refer to various types of cancerous tissues. Specific types of tumors are not mentioned, so we need to consider common cancerous tissues.
- **Normal adjacent tissue**: This implies tissues surrounding the tumor, which could be any organ part adjacent to common cancer sites.
- **Peripheral blood**: This is a specific term referring to blood circulating in the body, which is a distinct organ part.
### Context ###
- The abstract focuses on cancer treatment and T cell distribution in various tissues, including tumors, adjacent normal tissues, and peripheral blood.
- The context suggests a broad application across different cancer types, but no specific organ part is explicitly mentioned.
### Conclusion ###
Given the context and the terms used:
- **Tumours** and **normal adjacent tissue** are too general to pinpoint specific organ parts without more context.
- **Peripheral blood** is a specific organ part mentioned directly in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Peripheral blood']
