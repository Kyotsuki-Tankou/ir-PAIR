### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" are mentioned, indicating these are the technologies used in the study.
### Verify ###
The abstract states:
- "Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics."
This statement clearly verifies that both "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" are the primary technologies employed in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear mention of both technologies in the abstract, we can confidently conclude that "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" are the appropriate technologies to be extracted according to the schema.
### Result ###
["single-cell RNA sequencing", "spatial transcriptomics"]
