###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "spatial transcriptomics" stands out as a key technology mentioned in the context of studying Alzheimer's disease.
###Verify###
The abstract explicitly states that "we investigate here, in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in a 100-Î¼m diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics." This confirms the use of spatial transcriptomics as the technology in the study.
###Conclusion###
Given the direct mention and use of "spatial transcriptomics" in the abstract, we can conclude that this is the technology employed in the study.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
