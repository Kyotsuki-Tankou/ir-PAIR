###Keywords###
From the input, the terms "spatial transcriptomics," "single-cell RNA profile," and "molecular atlas" suggest that a technology related to spatial transcriptomics is used in the study. The keyword here is "Spatial Transcriptomics."
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "whole-brain spatial transcriptomics" and "molecular information," which implies the use of a spatial transcriptomics technology.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention of "spatial transcriptomics," we can confidently conclude that 'Spatial Transcriptomics' is the technology used in the study.
###Result###
['Spatial Transcriptomics']
