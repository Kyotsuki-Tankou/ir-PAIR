### Keywords ###
The keywords from the input that stand out are "adult mouse brain," "spatial transcriptomics," "neuroanatomical organization," "isocortex," "hippocampus," and "striatum." These keywords suggest that the study is focused on the brain and its various regions.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "a systematic classification of the adult mouse brain" and "the complex and detailed neuroanatomical organization of the brain," which directly verifies that the study is focused on the brain and its parts. It also mentions specific regions such as "isocortex," "hippocampus," and "striatum," indicating a detailed mapping of the brain's structure.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on the neuroanatomical organization and the mention of specific brain regions, we can infer that the study involves a comprehensive mapping of the brain's structure using spatial transcriptomics.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we can conclude that several parts of the brain are involved in this study, including the "isocortex," "hippocampus," and "striatum."
### Result ###
['isocortex', 'hippocampus', 'striatum']
