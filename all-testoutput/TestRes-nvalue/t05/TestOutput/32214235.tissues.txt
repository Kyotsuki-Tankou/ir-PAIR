### Keywords ###
The abstract mentions "all major human organs" and constructing a "human cell landscape (HCL)," which suggests that various human tissues are involved in the study.
### Verify ###
The abstract explicitly states the use of single-cell mRNA sequencing to determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs. This verifies that multiple human tissues are indeed part of the research.
### Context ###
While the abstract does not list specific tissues, the context implies a comprehensive analysis of various human organs, which aligns with the schema's inclusion of various human tissues.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the abstract's indication of a comprehensive single-cell analysis of major human organs, we can conclude that multiple tissues from the schema are likely involved.
### Result ###
null
