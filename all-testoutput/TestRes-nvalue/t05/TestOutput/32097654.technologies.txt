### Keywords ###
The keywords that stand out from the abstract are "single-cell RNA sequencing," "blastema," "digit tip regeneration," and "fibroblast heterogeneity." These suggest that 'scRNA-seq' (single-cell RNA sequencing) might be a relevant technology.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "we present single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas and unamputated control digit tips"
This directly verifies that 'scRNA-seq' is indeed the relevant technology used in the study.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing," there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this technology.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'scRNA-seq' as our final result.
### Result ###
['scRNA-seq']
