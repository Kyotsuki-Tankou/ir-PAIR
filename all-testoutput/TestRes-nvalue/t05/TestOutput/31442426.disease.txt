### Keywords ###
The abstract does not directly mention any diseases from the schema. However, the focus on mRNA processing, translation, and decay, as well as the mention of stress granules, could suggest implications for certain diseases related to these cellular processes.
### Verify ###
The abstract does not explicitly state any diseases. It focuses on the development of an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq, and its application in mapping the RNA composition of stress granules and translation initiation complexes.
### Context ###
Given that the abstract is centered around the cellular processes of mRNA and the techniques used to study them, there is no direct mention of any diseases. However, understanding these processes is crucial for diseases related to mRNA dysregulation.
### Conclusion ###
Since the abstract does not mention any diseases from the schema, we cannot match it to any of the given options.
### Result ###
null
