###Keywords###
The abstract mentions "human organs" and "human cell landscape," which implies that the study involves multiple human organ parts.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "Here we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs," which directly verifies that the study involves various human organ parts.
###Context###
The abstract provides a broad overview of the study's scope, which includes "all major human organs." This suggests that the study encompasses a wide range of organ parts, but does not specify individual organ parts from the schema.
###Conclusion###
Given the lack of specific mention of any organ parts from the schema, we cannot conclude that any particular organ part is the focus of the study.
###Result###
null
