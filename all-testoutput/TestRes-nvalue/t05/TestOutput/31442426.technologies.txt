### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "APEX-seq" is mentioned as a developed RNA proximity labeling technique, indicating that 'APEX-seq' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq," which directly references the technology APEX-seq. This further verifies that 'APEX-seq' is indeed a relevant and proper result.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear and direct mention of "APEX-seq" in both the abstract and the result, we can confidently conclude that the technology developed and used in the study is 'APEX-seq'.
### Result ###
['APEX-seq']
