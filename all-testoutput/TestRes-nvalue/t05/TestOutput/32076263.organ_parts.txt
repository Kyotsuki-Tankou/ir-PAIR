###Keywords###
From the abstract, the term "gastruloids" is mentioned multiple times, indicating that it is a key aspect of the study.
###Verify###
The abstract states:
- "Gastruloids are three-dimensional aggregates of embryonic stem cells..."
- "Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos..."
- "This study thus shows the power of gastruloids as a model system..."
These statements clearly verify that "gastruloids" are the primary focus of the study.
###Context###
Upon reviewing the context, "gastruloids" are described as aggregates of embryonic stem cells that mimic mammalian development. This suggests that they are a model system rather than a specific organ part.
###Conclusion###
Given the context, "gastruloids" do not correspond to any specific organ parts listed in the schema.
###Result###
null
