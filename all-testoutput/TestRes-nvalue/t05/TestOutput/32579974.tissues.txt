### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)" and "normal skin" directly indicate the tissues involved. This suggests that 'Skin' may be a proper result.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin," which explicitly verifies that 'Skin' is indeed a relevant tissue in the context of the study.
### Context ###
Since the verification step directly confirms the presence of 'Skin' in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to support this conclusion.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'Skin' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Skin']
