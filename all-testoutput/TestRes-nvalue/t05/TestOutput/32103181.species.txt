### Keywords ###
From the Abstract, the term "patients with different types of cancer" and "humans" is implied, suggesting that 'Homo sapiens' may be the relevant species.
### Verify ###
The Abstract specifically mentions "patients with different types of cancer" and "performing deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors in patients," which further verifies that the study is conducted on human subjects, aligning with 'Homo sapiens'.
### Context ###
Given the detailed focus on human patients and the clinical context of cancer treatment in humans, there is no need for additional context to confirm the relevance of 'Homo sapiens'.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Homo sapiens' as the final result based on the clear and consistent focus on human patients throughout the abstract.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
