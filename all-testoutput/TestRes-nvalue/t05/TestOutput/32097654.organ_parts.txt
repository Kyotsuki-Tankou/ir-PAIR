###Keywords###
The term "mouse digit tip blastemas" suggests that 'Mouse Embryo' may be a proper result. The term "digit tip regeneration" implies that 'Tibialis anterior muscle' could be a relevant organ part as muscles are involved in the movement of digits.
###Verify###
The abstract mentions "single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas," which verifies that the study is indeed focused on 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Tibialis anterior muscle' as potential organ parts involved in the regeneration process.
###Context###
The context of the study involves the regeneration of mouse digit tips, which involves the blastema, a structure known from limb regeneration in lower vertebrates. The study focuses on progenitor cells and their lineages, which are key components of embryonic development and regeneration processes.
###Conclusion###
Based on the verification of the terms used in the abstract and the context of the study, we can conclude that 'Mouse Embryo' and 'Tibialis anterior muscle' are relevant organ parts for this research on digit tip regeneration.
###Result###
['Mouse Embryo', 'Tibialis anterior muscle']
