### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells," "osteoblasts," and "adipocytes" suggest that 'Bone marrow' and possibly 'Bone' may be relevant results.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "Bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells"
- "delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths into osteoblasts and adipocytes"
This directly verifies the presence of 'Bone marrow' as it is the primary context of the study. 'Bone' is also relevant due to the mention of osteoblasts, which are bone-forming cells.
### Context ###
Given the focus on mesenchymal lineage cells in the bone marrow and their differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes, the context supports the relevance of both 'Bone marrow' and 'Bone'.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit references to bone marrow and bone-related cell types, we conclude that both 'Bone marrow' and 'Bone' are appropriate results.
### Result ###
['Bone marrow', 'Bone']
