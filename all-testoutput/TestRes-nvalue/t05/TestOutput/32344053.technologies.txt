### Keywords ###
The keywords from the abstract include "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "suction blistering," which suggest advanced sequencing technologies and a novel method for sample collection.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions the use of "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "suction blistering," which are both methods used to study the transcriptomic and proteomic levels of atopic dermatitis. This aligns with the keywords provided.
### Context ###
The abstract describes the use of suction blistering as a method for sampling skin cells and interstitial fluid, which is compared to conventional biopsies. It also mentions the use of single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptional profiles of key inflammatory pathways.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the context provided, "single-cell RNA sequencing" is a technology that was used in the study, as mentioned in the abstract. However, "suction blistering" is a method for sample collection and not a technology listed in the schema.
### Result ###
['single-cell RNA sequencing']
