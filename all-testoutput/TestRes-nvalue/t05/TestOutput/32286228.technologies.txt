### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the keyword "single cell RNA-seq" directly indicates the use of a specific technology.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "by employing large scale single cell transcriptome analysis," which directly verifies the use of single-cell RNA sequencing technology. This is consistent with the keyword "single cell RNA-seq."
### Context ###
The abstract explicitly states the use of "single cell transcriptome analysis," which is a clear indication of the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). There is no conflicting information that would require additional context to clarify.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mention of "single cell transcriptome analysis" and the keyword "single cell RNA-seq," we can confidently conclude that 'scRNA' is the correct technology used in the study.
### Result ###
['scRNA']
