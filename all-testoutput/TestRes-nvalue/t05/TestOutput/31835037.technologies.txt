### Keywords ###
From the abstract and keywords, the terms "Spatial transcriptomics," "single-cell RNA sequencing," and "in situ sequencing" are explicitly mentioned, indicating that 'Spatial Transcriptomics,' 'scRNA,' and 'in situ sequencing' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
- The abstract states: "Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles," which directly verifies the presence of 'Spatial Transcriptomics.'
- It also mentions: "Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing," which verifies 'scRNA.'
- Additionally, "In situ sequencing was then used to refine these results," verifies 'in situ sequencing.'
### Context ###
- No additional context is needed as the abstract clearly mentions the specific technologies used in the study.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Spatial Transcriptomics,' 'scRNA,' and 'in situ sequencing' as our final results based on the explicit mentions in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'scRNA', 'in situ sequencing']
