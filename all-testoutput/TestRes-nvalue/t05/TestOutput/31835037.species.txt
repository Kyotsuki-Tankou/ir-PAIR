### Keywords ###
The abstract mentions "human cardiac morphogenesis" and "human embryonic heart," which suggest that 'Homo sapiens' is the species being studied.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans is incompletely understood," and "Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages." This verifies that 'Homo sapiens' is indeed the species under investigation.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly discusses the study of human cardiac morphogenesis and embryonic heart development, there is no need for additional context to confirm the species.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the clear mention of human cardiac morphogenesis and embryonic heart development, we can confidently conclude that 'Homo sapiens' is the correct species for this study.
### Result ###
['Homo sapiens']
