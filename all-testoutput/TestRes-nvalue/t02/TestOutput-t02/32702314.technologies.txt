### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out in relation to technologies are "spatial transcriptomics" and "in situ sequencing". These terms directly relate to the methods used for analyzing gene expression in specific tissue domains.
### Verify ###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "using spatial transcriptomics"
- "using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections"
These points verify that the study employed both "spatial transcriptomics" and "in situ sequencing" technologies.
### Context ###
The context provided in the abstract is clear and directly mentions the technologies used. There is no ambiguity or need for further context to identify the technologies.
### Conclusion ###
Based on the explicit mentions in the abstract, "spatial transcriptomics" and "in situ sequencing" are the technologies used in the study. While "in situ sequencing" is not listed in the schema, "seqFISH" and "seqFISH+" are related techniques that could be considered if "in situ sequencing" is a broader term encompassing these specific methods.
### Result ###
['Spatial Transcriptomics', 'seqFISH', 'seqFISH+'] 
(Note: "seqFISH" and "seqFISH+" are included as they are specific forms of in situ sequencing that might be relevant, though the exact match for "in situ sequencing" is not directly listed in the schema.)
