### Keywords ###
From the input, the keywords that stand out are "all major human organs," "human cell landscape (HCL)," and "many tissues." These terms suggest a broad analysis across various tissues.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "all major human organs" and "many tissues," indicating a comprehensive study that includes multiple tissue types. However, it does not specify which particular tissues are involved.
### Context ###
Given the broad scope of the study, it is reasonable to infer that the analysis covers a wide range of tissues. The mention of "all major human organs" suggests that the study is not limited to a single tissue type but encompasses multiple tissues from the provided schema.
### Conclusion ###
Since the abstract does not specify individual tissues but indicates a comprehensive analysis of "all major human organs" and "many tissues," it is not possible to pinpoint specific tissues from the schema. Therefore, we cannot definitively match any specific tissue types from the given options.
### Result ###
null
