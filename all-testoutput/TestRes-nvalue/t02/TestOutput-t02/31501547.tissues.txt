###Keywords###
From the abstract, the keywords that stand out are "high-definition spatial transcriptomics", "histological tissue sections", "mouse brain", and "primary breast cancer". These keywords suggest a focus on tissue analysis, particularly in the brain and breast.
###Verify###
The abstract specifically mentions:
- "captures RNA from histological tissue sections"
- "demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer"
These points verify that the study involves tissues from the brain and breast.
###Context###
Not required in this case as the verification directly supports the keywords.
###Conclusion###
Given the explicit mention of "mouse brain" and "primary breast cancer", the tissues involved are clearly "Brain" and "Breast".
###Result###
['Brain', 'Breast']
