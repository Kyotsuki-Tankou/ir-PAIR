### Keywords ###
From the input, the keyword that stands out is "Homo sapiens," as the study involves "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients," which are human diseases.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients"
This directly verifies that the species involved is 'Homo sapiens'.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "patients," which implies humans, there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify the species.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Homo sapiens' as our final result.
### Result ###
["Homo sapiens"]
