### Keywords ###
The keywords from the abstract include "Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "amyloid plaques", "brain sections", and "spatial transcriptomics". These suggest that the relevant tissue might be related to the brain.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "mouse and human brain sections" and focuses on "Alzheimer's disease (AD)", which is a brain-related disorder. This verifies the relevance of "Brain" from the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Given the clear focus on brain tissue in both the mouse model and human sections in the context of Alzheimer's disease, we can conclusively choose "Brain" as the result.
### Result ###
['Brain']
