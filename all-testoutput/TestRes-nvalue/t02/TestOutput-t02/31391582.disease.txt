### Keywords ###
From the input, the terms "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "germ layers," and "embryogenesis" suggest a focus on early developmental processes. The term "Embryo development" from the schema seems to be the most relevant.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "post-implantation development of the mouse embryo," "germ layers are formed and cell lineages are specified," and "the establishment of the blueprint for embryogenesis." These statements clearly indicate that the study is focused on the early stages of embryo development, verifying that 'Embryo development' is indeed a proper result.
### Context ###
Since the terms related to embryo development are explicitly mentioned and directly correspond to 'Embryo development' in the schema, there is no need for additional context to verify the result.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Embryo development' as our final result based on the clear and direct mention of the developmental processes involved in the abstract.
### Result ###
['Embryo development']
