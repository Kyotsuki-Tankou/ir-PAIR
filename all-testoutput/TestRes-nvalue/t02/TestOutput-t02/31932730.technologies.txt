###Keywords###
From the abstract, the terms "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)" and "spatial transcriptomics" are prominently mentioned. This suggests that 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' may be proper results.
###Verify###
The abstract states, "We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method... with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample." This further verifies that both 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' are indeed technologies used in the study.
###Context###
Given the explicit mention of combining scRNA-seq with a spatial transcriptomics method, there is no need for additional context to confirm the results.
###Conclusion###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' and 'Spatial Transcriptomics' as our final results.
###Result###
['scRNA', 'Spatial Transcriptomics']
