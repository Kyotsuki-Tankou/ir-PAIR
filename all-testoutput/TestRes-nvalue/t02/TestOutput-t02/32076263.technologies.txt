### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the terms "single-cell RNA sequencing" and "spatial transcriptomics" directly indicate the technologies used in the study.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions:
- "compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics."
This confirms that the technologies used are 'single-cell RNA sequencing' and 'spatial transcriptomics'.
### Conclusion ###
Since the keywords and the abstract both consistently point to 'single-cell RNA sequencing' and 'spatial transcriptomics', we can confidently conclude that these are the correct technologies used in the study.
### Result ###
['single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatial transcriptomics']
