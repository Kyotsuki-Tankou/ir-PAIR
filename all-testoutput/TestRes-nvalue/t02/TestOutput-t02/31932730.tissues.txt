### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "primary pancreatic tumors" is mentioned, indicating that 'Pancreas' and 'Tumor' may be proper results. Additionally, "multimodal intersection analysis" and "spatial transcriptomics" suggest a focus on tissue structure, which could imply 'Pancreas' as a key tissue.
### Verify ###
The abstract states, "Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors," which directly references the tissue type being studied. This further verifies that 'Pancreas' and 'Tumor' are indeed relevant and proper results.
### Context ###
Given the direct and clear mention of "primary pancreatic tumors" in the abstract, there is no need for additional context to verify the keywords.
### Conclusion ###
