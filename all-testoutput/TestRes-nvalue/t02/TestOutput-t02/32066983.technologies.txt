### Keywords ###
From the abstract, the term "single-cell RNA-sequencing" directly indicates that 'scRNA' or 'RNA-seq' may be proper results.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN," which verifies that 'scRNA' is indeed the technology used in the study. Additionally, 'RNA-seq' is a broader term that could also apply, but 'scRNA' is more specific to the context provided.
### Context ###
The context is clear as the abstract specifically mentions the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing, which aligns perfectly with 'scRNA' from the schema.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we choose 'scRNA' as our final result, as it is the most specific and directly mentioned technology.
### Result ###
['scRNA']
