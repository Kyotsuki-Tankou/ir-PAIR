### Keywords ###
From "suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus" and "mouse SCN" in the Abstract, it indicates that 'Suprachiasmatic nucleus' and 'Mouse' may be relevant results.
### Verify ###
The Abstract mentions "single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN" and "three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse SCN at single-cell resolution," which further verifies that 'Suprachiasmatic nucleus' is a proper result. Additionally, the focus on the mouse model confirms 'Mouse' as relevant.
### Context ###
While 'Mouse' is not explicitly listed in the schema under organ_parts, 'Suprachiasmatic nucleus' is directly mentioned and fits well within the context of the schema. The term 'Mouse' is more general and not specifically listed, so it may not be considered a direct match for the organ_parts schema.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, we confirm 'Suprachiasmatic nucleus' as our final result based on the direct mention and relevance to the schema. 'Mouse' is relevant but not a direct match for the organ_parts schema.
### Result ###
['Suprachiasmatic nucleus']
