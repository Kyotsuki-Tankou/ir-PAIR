### Keywords ###
From the "Abstract," the terms "heart," "coronary sinus samples," and "cardiac" suggest a focus on specific parts of the heart.
### Verify ###
The abstract mentions "aptamer-based proteomics to identify proteins associated with prospective HF incidence," "leveraging coronary sinus samples," and "describe likely cardiac and specific cellular origins for several of the proteins." This implies that specific regions of the heart are being studied in detail, which could include the "Coronary sinus" and other cardiac tissues.
### Context ###
To further verify, we need to infer from the context:
- "By leveraging coronary sinus samples and transcriptomic tools, we describe likely cardiac and specific cellular origins for several of the proteins."
This indicates that specific regions within the heart, particularly the coronary sinus, are being analyzed for protein expression patterns, which aligns with the detailed study of particular heart parts.
### Conclusion ###
Given the context and the specific mention of "coronary sinus samples," it is reasonable to conclude that "Coronary sinus" is a specific organ part being studied. However, the abstract does not explicitly mention other specific parts like "Right atrial appendage (RAA)" or "Left ventricular needle (LV)."
### Result ###
['Coronary sinus']
