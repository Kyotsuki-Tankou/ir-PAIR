### Keywords ###
From the input, the keyword that stands out is "heart development." This suggests that 'Heart development' might be a relevant disease.
### Verify ###
In the abstract, it is mentioned:
- "The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans"
- "a deep exploration of the organ-wide orchestration of gene expression with a single-cell spatial resolution"
- "we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages"
- "Keywords: gene expression; heart development; human development; human developmental cell atlas; in situ sequencing; single-cell RNA-sequencing; spatial transcriptomics; spatially resolved transcriptomics."
These phrases directly verify that 'Heart development' is indeed a relevant disease.
### Context ###
Since the abstract explicitly mentions "heart development" multiple times and it is also listed in the keywords, there is no ambiguity or need for further context to verify this disease.
### Conclusion ###
Consequently, based on the explicit mention in the abstract, we choose 'Heart development' as our final result.
### Result ###
['Heart development']
