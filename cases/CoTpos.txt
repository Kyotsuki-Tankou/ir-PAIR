Abstract: The developing brain has a well-organized anatomical structure comprising different types of neural and non-neural cells. Stem cells, progenitors and newborn neurons tightly interact with their neighbouring cells and tissue microenvironment, and this intricate interplay ultimately shapes the output of neurogenesis. Given the relevance of spatial cues during brain development, we acknowledge the necessity for a spatial transcriptomics map accessible to the neurodevelopmental community. To fulfil this need, we generated spatially resolved RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from embryonic day 13.5 mouse brain sections immunostained for mitotic active neural and vascular cells. Unsupervised clustering defined specific cell type populations of diverse lineages and differentiation states. Differential expression analysis revealed unique transcriptional signatures across specific brain areas, uncovering novel features inherent to particular anatomical domains. Finally, we integrated existing single-cell RNAseq datasets into our spatial transcriptomics map, adding tissue context to single-cell RNAseq data. In summary, we provide a valuable tool that enables the exploration and discovery of unforeseen molecular players involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the crosstalk between different cell types.

Abstract: Background: Rhynchophylline (RHY) is an alkaloid component of Uncaria, which are plants extensively used in traditional Asian medicines. Uncaria treatments increase sleep time and quality in humans, and RHY induces sleep in rats. However, like many traditional natural treatments, the mechanisms of action of RHY and Uncaria remain evasive. Moreover, it is unknown whether RHY modifies key brain oscillations during sleep. We thus aimed at defining the effects of RHY on sleep architecture and oscillations throughout a 24-h cycle, as well as identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mice received systemic RHY injections at two times of the day (beginning and end of the light period), and vigilance states were studied by electrocorticographic recordings. Results: RHY enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS) after both injections, suppressed paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light but enhanced PS in the dark period. Furthermore, RHY modified brain oscillations during both wakefulness and SWS (including delta activity dynamics) in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, most effects were larger in females. A brain spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that RHY modifies the expression of genes linked to cell movement, apoptosis/necrosis, and transcription/translation in a brain region-independent manner, and changes those linked to sleep regulation (e.g., Hcrt, Pmch) in a brain region-specific manner (e.g., in the hypothalamus).Conclusions: The findings provide support to the sleep-inducing effect of RHY, expose the relevance to shape wake/sleep oscillations, and highlight its effects on the transcriptome with a high spatial resolution. The exposed molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of a natural compound should benefit sleep- and brain-related medicine.

Abstract:Background: The mechanism underlying cervical carcinogenesis that is mediated by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection remains elusive. Aims: Here, for the first time, we deciphered both the temporal transition and spatial distribution of cellular subsets during disease progression from normal cervix tissues to precursor lesions to cervical cancer. Materials & methods: We generated scRNA-seq profiles and spatial transcriptomics data from nine patient samples, including two HPV-negative normal, two HPV-positive normal, two HPV-positive HSIL and three HPV-positive cancer samples. Results: We not only identified three 'HPV-related epithelial clusters' that are unique to normal, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cervical cancer tissues but also discovered node genes that potentially regulate disease progression. Moreover, we observed the gradual transition of multiple immune cells that exhibited positive immune responses, followed by dysregulation and exhaustion, and ultimately established an immune-suppressive microenvironment during the malignant program. In addition, analysis of cellular interactions further verified that a 'homeostasis-balance-malignancy' change occurred within the cervical microenvironment during disease progression. Discussion: We for the first time presented a spatiotemporal atlas that systematically described the cellular heterogeneity and spatial map along the four developmental steps of HPV-related cervical oncogenesis, including normal, HPV-positive normal, HSIL and cancer. We identified three unique HPV-related clusters, discovered critical node genes that determined the cell fate and uncovered the immune remodeling during disease escalation. Conclusion: Together, these findings provided novel possibilities for accurate diagnosis, precise treatment and prognosis evaluation of patients with precancer and cervical cancer.
