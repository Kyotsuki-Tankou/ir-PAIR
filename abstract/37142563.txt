 Abstract\nGlioblastoma (GBM) diffusely infiltrates the brain and intermingles with non-neoplastic brain cells, including astrocytes, neurons and microglia/myeloid cells. This complex mixture of cell types forms the biological context for therapeutic response and tumor recurrence. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular composition and transcriptional states in primary and recurrent glioma and identified three compositional 'tissue-states' defined by cohabitation patterns between specific subpopulations of neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain cells. These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival. Treating acute slices of GBM with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor depleted the transcriptional signature of this pernicious tissue-state. These findings point to therapies that target interdependencies in the GBM microenvironment.
