 Abstract\nNeuroendocrine prostate carcinoma (NEPC) accounts for less than 1% of prostate neoplasms and has extremely poorer prognosis than the typical androgen receptor pathway-positive adenocarcinoma of the prostate (ARPC). However, very few cases in which de novo NEPC and APRC are diagnosed simultaneously in the same tissue have been reported. We report herein a 78-year-old man of de novo metastatic NEPC coexisting with ARPC treated at Ehime University Hospital. Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression analysis (10Ã— genetics) was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. The neuroendocrine signatures were upregulated in NEPC sites, and androgen receptor signatures were upregulated in ARPC sites. TP53, RB1, or PTEN and upregulation of the homologous recombination repair genes at NEPC sites were not downregulated. Urothelial carcinoma markers were not elevated. Meanwhile, Rbfox3 and SFRTM2 levels were downregulated while the levels of the fibrosis markers HGF, HMOX1, ELN, and GREM1 were upregulated in the tumor microenvironment of NEPC. In conclusion, the findings of spatial gene expression analysis in a patient with coexisting ARPC and de novo NEPC are reported. The accumulation of cases and basic data will help with the development of novel treatments for NEPC and improve the prognosis of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n Keywords:AR pathway prostate cancer; CytAssist Visium; de novo NEPC; gene expression; simultaneous occurrence; spatial transcriptomics; treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.
