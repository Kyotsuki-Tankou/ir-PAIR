 Abstract\nIntroduction:Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and brain diseases caused by acute injuries, are important, yet challenging to study due to disease lesion locations and other complexities.Methods:Utilizing the powerful method of spatial transcriptome analysis together with novel algorithms we developed for the study, we report here for the first time a 3D trajectory map of gene expression changes in the brain following acute neural injury using a mouse model of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). IVH is a common and representative complication after various acute brain injuries with severe mortality and mobility implications.Results:Our data identified three main 3D global pseudospace-time trajectory bundles that represent the main neural circuits from the lateral ventricle to the hippocampus and primary cortex affected by experimental IVH stimulation. Further analysis indicated a rapid response in the primary cortex, as well as a direct and integrated effect on the hippocampus after IVH stimulation.Discussion:These results are informative for understanding the pathophysiological changes, including the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression changes, in IVH patients after acute brain injury, strategizing more effective clinical management regimens, and developing novel bioinformatics strategies for the study of other CNS diseases. The algorithm strategies used in this study are searchable via a web service (www.combio-lezhang.online/3dstivh/home). \n Keywords:bioinformatics analysis; intraventricular haemorrhage; neural circuits; secondary brain injury; spatial transcriptome sequencing.
