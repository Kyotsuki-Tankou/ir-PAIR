 Abstract\nThe lacrimal gland (LG) is an exocrine gland that produces the watery part of the tear film that lubricates the ocular surface. Chronic inflammation, such as Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS), is one of the leading causes of aqueous-deficiency dry eye (ADDE) disease worldwide. In this study we analyzed the chronic inflammation in the LGs of the NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J (NOD.H-2b) mice, a mouse model of SS, utilizing bulk RNAseq and Visium spatial gene expression. With Seurat we performed unsupervised clustering and analyzed the spatial cell distribution and gene expression changes in all cell clusters within the LG sections. Moreover, for the first time, we analyzed and validated specific pathways defined by bulk RNAseq using Visium technology to determine activation of these pathways within the LG sections. This analysis suggests that altered metabolism and the hallmarks of inflammatory responses from both epithelial and immune cells drive inflammation. The most significant pathway enriched in upregulated DEGs was the "TYROBP Causal Network", that has not been described previously in SS. We also noted a significant decrease in lipid metabolism in the LG of theNOD.H-2bmice. Our data suggests that modulation of these pathways can provide a therapeutic strategy to treat ADDE. \n Keywords:RNA sequencing; TYROBP; chronic inflammation; lacrimal gland; lipid metabolism; macrophages; spatial transcriptomics; visium.
