 Abstract\nAims:Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited cardiac disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of myocardium that is replaced by fibro-fatty cells, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. While myocardial degeneration and fibro-fatty replacement occur in specific locations, the underlying molecular changes remain poorly characterized. Here, we aim to delineate local changes in gene expression to identify new genes and pathways that are relevant for specific remodelling processes occurring during ACM.Methods and results:Using Tomo-Seq, genome-wide transcriptional profiling with high spatial resolution, we created transmural epicardial-to-endocardial gene expression atlases of explanted ACM hearts to gain molecular insights into disease-driving processes. This enabled us to link gene expression profiles to the different regional remodelling responses and allowed us to identify genes that are potentially relevant for disease progression. In doing so, we identified distinct gene expression profiles marking regions of cardiomyocyte degeneration and fibro-fatty remodelling and revealed Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 11 (ZBTB11) to be specifically enriched at sites of active fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium. Immunohistochemistry indicated ZBTB11 to be induced in cardiomyocytes flanking fibro-fatty areas, which could be confirmed in multiple cardiomyopathy patients. Forced overexpression of ZBTB11 induced autophagy and cell death-related gene programmes in human cardiomyocytes, leading to increased apoptosis.Conclusion:Our study shows the power of Tomo-Seq to unveil new molecular mechanisms in human cardiomyopathy and uncovers ZBTB11 as a novel driver of cardiomyocyte loss. \n Keywords:Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy; Cardiomyocyte degeneration; Tomo-Seq; ZBTB11.
