 Abstract\nBackground & aims:As pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to be recalcitrant to therapeutic interventions, including poor response to immunotherapy, albeit effective in other solid malignancies, a more nuanced understanding of the immune microenvironment in PDAC is urgently needed. We aimed to unveil a detailed view of the immune micromilieu in PDAC using a spatially resolved multimodal single-cell approach.Methods:We applied single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and mass cytometry to profile the immune compartment in treatment-na√Øve PDAC tumors and matched adjacent normal pancreatic tissue, as well as in the systemic circulation. We determined prognostic associations of immune signatures and performed a meta-analysis of the immune microenvironment in PDAC and lung adenocarcinoma on single-cell level.Results:We provided a spatially resolved fine map of the immune landscape in PDAC. We substantiated the exhausted phenotype of CD8 T cells and immunosuppressive features of myeloid cells, and highlighted immune subsets with potentially underappreciated roles in PDAC that diverged from immune populations within adjacent normal areas, particularly CD4 T cell subsets and natural killer T cells that are terminally exhausted and acquire a regulatory phenotype. Differential analysis of immune phenotypes in PDAC and lung adenocarcinoma revealed the presence of extraordinarily immunosuppressive subtypes in PDAC, along with a distinctive immune checkpoint composition.Conclusions:Our study sheds light on the multilayered immune dysfunction in PDAC and presents a holistic view of the immune landscape in PDAC and lung adenocarcinoma, providing a comprehensive resource for functional studies and the exploration of therapeutically actionable targets in PDAC. \n Keywords:Lung Cancer; Pancreatic Cancer; Single-Cell Multi-Omics; Tumor Immunology.
