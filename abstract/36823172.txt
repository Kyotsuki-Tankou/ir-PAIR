 Abstract\nDiffuse midline glioma-H3K27M mutant (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are the most lethal brain tumors that primarily occur in pediatric and adult patients, respectively. Both tumors exhibit significant heterogeneity, shaped by distinct genetic/epigenetic drivers, transcriptional programs including RNA splicing, and microenvironmental cues in glioma niches. However, the spatial organization of cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be investigated. Here, we perform a spatial profiling of DMG and GBM combining short- and long-read spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell transcriptomic datasets. We identify clinically relevant transcriptional programs, RNA isoform diversity, and multi-cellular ecosystems across different glioma niches. We find that while the tumor core enriches for oligodendrocyte precursor-like cells, radial glial stem-like (RG-like) cells are enriched in the neuron-rich invasive niche in both DMG and GBM. Further, we identify niche-specific regulatory programs for RG-like cells, and functionally confirm that FAM20C mediates invasive growth of RG-like cells in a neuron-rich microenvironment in a human neural stem cell derived orthotopic DMG model. Together, our results provide a blueprint for understanding the spatial architecture and niche-specific vulnerabilities of DMG and GBM.
