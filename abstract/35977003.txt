 Abstract\nImmune checkpoint blockade is therapeutically successful for many patients across multiple cancer types. However, immune-related adverse events (irAE) frequently occur and can sometimes be life threatening. It is critical to understand the immunologic mechanisms of irAEs with the goal of finding novel treatment targets. Herein, we report our analysis of tissues from patients with irAE dermatitis using multiparameter immunofluorescence (IF), spatial transcriptomics, and RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). Skin psoriasis cases were studied as a comparison, as a known Th17-driven disease, and colitis was investigated as a comparison. IF analysis revealed that CD4+ and CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells were preferentially expanded in the inflamed portion of skin in cutaneous irAEs compared with healthy skin controls. Spatial transcriptomics allowed us to focus on areas containing TRM cells to discern functional phenotype and revealed expression of Th1-associated genes in irAEs, compared with Th17-asociated genes in psoriasis. Expression of PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and other inhibitory receptors was observed in irAE cases. RISH technology combined with IF confirmed expression of IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL10, and TNFα in irAE dermatitis, as well as IFNγ within TRM cells specifically. The Th1-skewed phenotype was confirmed in irAE colitis cases compared with healthy colon.
