 Abstract\nThe presence of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with positive clinical outcomes and responses to immunotherapy in cancer. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to examine the nature of B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). B cells were enriched in TLS, and therein, we could identify all B cell maturation stages toward plasma cell (PC) formation. B cell repertoire analysis revealed clonal diversification, selection, expansion in TLS, and the presence of fully mature clonotypes at distance. In TLS+ tumors, IgG- and IgA-producing PCs disseminated into the tumor beds along fibroblastic tracks. TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity. Therapeutic responses and progression-free survival correlated with IgG-stained tumor cells in RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, intratumoral TLS sustains B cell maturation and antibody production that is associated with response to immunotherapy, potentially via direct anti-tumor effects. \n Keywords:B cell maturation; B cell repertoire; Visium; anti-tumor IgG; fibroblasts; plasma cells; renal cell cancer; response to immune check point inhibition; spatial transcriptomics; tertiary lymphoid structures; tumor microenvironment.
