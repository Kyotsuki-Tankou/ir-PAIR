 Abstract\nSpatial and molecular characteristics determine tissue function, yet high-resolution methods to capture both concurrently are lacking. Here, we developed high-definition spatial transcriptomics, which captures RNA from histological tissue sections on a dense, spatially barcoded bead array. Each experiment recovers several hundred thousand transcript-coupled spatial barcodes at 2-Î¼m resolution, as demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer. This opens the way to high-resolution spatial analysis of cells and tissues.
