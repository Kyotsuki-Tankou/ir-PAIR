 Abstract\nHepatic metastasis is a clinical challenge for colorectal cancer (CRC). Senescent cancer cells accumulate in CRC favoring tumor dissemination. Whether this mechanism progresses also in metastasis is unexplored. Here, we integrated spatial transcriptomics, 3D-microscopy, and multicellular transcriptomics to study the role of cellular senescence in human colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). We discovered two distinct senescent metastatic cancer cell (SMCC) subtypes, transcriptionally located at the opposite pole of epithelial (e) to mesenchymal (m) transition. SMCCs differ in chemotherapy susceptibility, biological program, and prognostic roles. Mechanistically, epithelial (e)SMCC initiation relies on nucleolar stress, whereby c-myc dependent oncogene hyperactivation induces ribosomal RPL11 accumulation and DNA damage response. In a 2D pre-clinical model, we demonstrated that RPL11 co-localized with HDM2, a p53-specific ubiquitin ligase, leading to senescence activation in (e)SMCCs. On the contrary, mesenchymal (m)SMCCs undergo TGFÎ² paracrine activation of NOX4-p15 effectors. SMCCs display opposing effects also in the immune regulation of neighboring cells, establishing an immunosuppressive environment or leading to an active immune workflow. Both SMCC signatures are predictive biomarkers whose unbalanced ratio determined the clinical outcome in CRLM and CRC patients. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive new understanding of the role of SMCCs in CRLM and highlight their potential as new therapeutic targets to limit CRLM progression. \n Keywords:EMT; cellular senescence; colorectal cancer liver metastasis; prognostic role; senescence-associated secretory phenotype; spatial transcriptomics.
