 Abstract\nStudies on the etiopathogenesis of keloids mostly have focused on fibroblasts and their dysfunction. In this study, two cutting-edge technologies, single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, were applied to uncover the underlying pathophysiology of keloids. Keloid tissue samples and normal skin control data were analyzed as well as those of patient-matched keloid and normal mature scar. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed cellular heterogenicity such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), and myofibroblasts within the keloids. Spatial transcriptomics results showed that disease-associated fibroblasts were enriched in the deeper keloid areas, mostly located around the spots with endothelial transcripts. Mesenchymal activation was observed in keloid ECs, characterized by dysregulation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Colocalization of mesenchymal and vascular markers through multiplex immunofluorescence suggested mesenchymal activation of keloid ECs. Cell‒cell interaction analysis identified a significant network between keloid fibroblasts and ECs, and this cellular crosstalk was supported by colocalization analysis of spatial transcriptomics. This study depicted the cellular landscape of keloids at a single-cell resolution as well as the integration of single-cell and valuable spatial data of keloids using spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence technologies. Our findings suggested a potential role of fibrovascular communication and mesenchymal activation of ECs that might be involved in the keloid pathogenesis.
