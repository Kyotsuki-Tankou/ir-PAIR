 Abstract\nDuring mammalian embryogenesis, spatial regulation of gene expression and cell signaling are functionally coupled with lineage specification, patterning of tissue progenitors, and germ layer morphogenesis. While the mouse model has been instrumental for understanding mammalian development, comparatively little is known about human and non-human primate gastrulation due to the restriction of both technical and ethical issues. Here, we present a spatial and temporal survey of the molecular dynamics of cell types populating the non-human primate embryos during gastrulation. We reconstructed three-dimensional digital models from serial sections of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) gastrulating embryos at 1-day temporal resolution from E17 to E21. Spatial transcriptomics identifies gene expression profiles unique to the germ layers. Cross-species comparison reveals a developmental coordinate of germ layer segregation between mouse and primates, and species-specific transcription programs during gastrulation. These findings offer insights into evolutionarily conserved and divergent processes during mammalian gastrulation. \n Keywords:CP: Developmental biology; anatomical atlas; cross-species comparison; gastrulation; germ layers; mammalian embryogenesis; monkey embryo; morphology; spatial transcriptome; three-dimensional digital models; tissue lineages.
