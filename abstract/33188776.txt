 Abstract\nWe present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue slide via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were used to deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of two sets of barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 2D mosaic of tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-Î¼m pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted by researchers with no experience in microfluidics and may find applications in a range of fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology. \n Keywords:high spatial resolution; in situ barcoding; mouse embryo; next-generation sequencing; spatial multi-omics.
